I think 5+ counters are open.
I got counter- 19

Vo: Please pass me ur passport n i20
Me: Good morning mam!(passed my docs)

Vo: Pass me your documents
Me. : Passed
Vo : Place your right hand fingers
Me : Placed.
Vo: So, Why are you going ?
Me : To pursue masters in computer science with Artificial Intelligence in Machine Vision as my specialisation

(He's rarely looking at me and kept on typing)

Vo : Why this university ?
Me : Kennesaw State University has a flexible course curriculum where I have the freedom of choosing subjects as per my area of interest. It is an R2 research university where we can find high research activity. The on going research in Machine Vision drew my attention and I'm eagerly waiting to pursue master's in this university. 

Vo : What were you doing now ? 
Me : I'm a recently passed out under graduate student in Computer Science engineering. 
Vo : What is your specialisation ?
Me : Artificial Intelligence
Vo : What about funding ?
Me : My father owns an electronic store and my mother is a professor.
Vo : Combined annual income ?
Me : 22LPA

Vo : Your visa is approved. Have a nice stay in US.

Literally me burst into tears and said thank you officer you made my day. I don't know why I'm getting tears but I couldn't control. It was my dream since childhood to go abroad. Nd this day will be forever memorable. After long struggle luckily I got slot when they released first time. Previous was May 7th. 

I went twice to Embassy and I could find more number of approvals nearly 95% are getting their visa. I have seen a guy fumbled and stammering and still his visa approved. My strong suggestion is that Be in formal attire and give your best in confident manner. Surely you will get. Carry all documents and some people were asked too. Be prepared and don't get nervous. VO are very friendly and they will try to give you approval if you do your job. 

All the best guys. I pray and I wish your dreams come true. Thanks to this channel for posting all the experiences. It's just boosting and also more helpful for anyone like me or the other. 

Stay safe | 😊

During my undergrad my primary focus was on design and structural analysis and I did numerous projects to augment my skills in this field. Now I wish to combine my childhood interests with my undergrad expertise and  pursue MS in Aerospace Engineering with structural mechanics as my specialization.
*Awkward silence for like 10 seconds, VO typing..*

I did not hear the golden words and my degree was Aerospace so I was skeptical whether as to have I actually got the visa or will they eventually put it on hold. But he did not mention about holds and I did not get any slips neither 221g nor approval slip (no one at the Kolkata consulate was getting approval slips afaik).
Later upon checking on ceac portal I found that my visa is issued and today (July 9th) I received my stamped passport. So, my visa was officially approved.

The visa groups were really helpful especially F1 visa interview experience group.

I was very nervous, could hear my heart beats but I took few deep breaths and kept myself calm.

-All I saw was green slips coming out. Just be confident and be prepared to answer the basic questions.

Let us in about 10 minutes early
Took exactly 1hr inside, was out at 12.
Status: APPROVED ✅

Couple notes:

- It's unbelievably hot and humid here and chennai consulate isn't first come first serve, so don't reach too early or you'll melt. They'll only let you in at the slot time anyway. 

- Chennai consulate doesn't have a locker facility and apparently from other experiences I saw that the rickshaw walas outside have started a scam where they'll take your stuff when you go in and say pay whatever you want, and then when you come back and ask for it, they'll squeeze you for a crapton of money. And waise bhi it's so unsafe to leave your valuables with them anyway. So kuch bhi karke leave phone/smartwatch/everything at the hotel only, or outside with your parents or something. 

- They asked me for a recent good quality passport size photo and when I didn't have it, they sent me to another counter to click it where the guy had some difficulty clicking it and it took some time. So maybe take a couple with you just for convenience. But nai hai toh bhi chalega ig.

- My DS 160 location was delhi, not chennai. I didn't end up filling a new one and just went ahead with this one. For me at least it wasn't an issue at all. Wasn't even mentioned.

- Talking with other students in line helps a lot to relax and calm your nerves before the interview

- Make sure your preparation and all is solid, then nothing will faze you

- Being in full formals is a great thing, even if it's not mentioned as mandatory or anything. It just makes you feel confident and powerful. And everyone else is pretty much in formals too, so you won't feel nervous or the odd one out.

EXPERIENCE:

""Hello, good morning sir!"" 

(No reply)
(He Asked passport, I-20. He was a bit cold and mumbling everything. Had to ask him to repeat a couple times, but I think that'll happen with everyone, not to worry...you just speak clearly and confidently)

(After couple seconds, he's like hmm no photo, go and take one here. Just before going there he said wait, what's the university? I told him. He nodded. It's a pretty good university so I think the interview was half finished here only)

Went to the other counter and got the photo. Came back. 

""Hello again sir, the photo is done, sorry about the delay, it seems there was some issue in capturing it. Here's my passport and I-20 again""

(Gave)

(Asked are you working right now)

""No sir, just graduated couple months ago. Did one internship during college however. ""

(Asked where I did undergrad)

(Told, along with the cgpa which was pretty good)

(Asked where I'm going in US)

(Told)

(Asked which degree)

(Told, explained it has different name in I20 because of name limitations)

(Again asked where I did undergrad)

(Told)

(Asked who's sponsoring me)

(Told: father)

(Asked what he does)

(Told)

(Asked if I've been to US before)

(Told: yes, for x number of days for tourism)

(Asked if the B1 B2 tourist visa is still valid)

(Told:yes)

He typed for a couple seconds, it was so tense and felt like soooo long. Then mumbled, visa is approved, will get it in 3-5 days with premium delivery, tore green slip and gave.

""Can I go, sir?""
(He said yes)

Walked out smiling and bouncing. Happiest day of my life so far. Freedom and a new life!

Best of luck to everyone else. Sabka hojayega, just keep at it and don't overthink too much!

I reached the Consulate at exactly 09:45 a.m.  I'm guessing that as there were very few people, my interview actually started well before my scheduled time and my VISA got approved by 10:20 a.m. itself.

Also from the entry point onwards there were several dispensers of hand sanitizer which made the hypochondriac in me sigh in relief.
Also, I had to remove my mask thrice for identity verification.

The Interview:-

VO: Bald American guy in his late 20s

VO: Good morning! (quite cheerily)
Me: Good morning, Officer! How're you doing today?

VO: I'm great! Thank you. Please give me your Passport and I20.
Me: Here they are...

VO then asked me to place 4 fingers of my right hand on the scanner. I did as asked.

VO: So, tell me about your Program.
Me: I'm going for a PhD in English Language and Literature at The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa.

VO: If I say, ""roll"", what would you say back?
(Here, I couldn't exactly hear what he was saying as his voice was getting muffled, probably because of the masks. And anyway, tbh, it might be also because I wasn't expecting this question at all. So, I asked again.)
Me: Sorry, couldn't quite get that...

VO: (repeats the question again and then I got what he was saying.)
Me: I'd tell you ""Roll Tide!""

VO: yeah! That's what I'm talking about! Alabama has a massive and fantastic football culture.
Me: Yeah, I'm gathering that, especially since their big win last season.

VO: started looking at his computer and typing...
(I wasn't sure if he said something so I asked ...)
Me: Sorry, did you ask me anything?
VO: No..no.. you're probably hearing people from the next counter.

We laughed a little.

VO: Congratulations! You're VISA is approved.
Me: Oh wow!! Thank you so much! Have a lovely day ahead!

I was so excited to hear those four magical words that I forgot to ask him when I'd get my passport back...and I rushed to the exit.

*VAC/OFC Experience*
Date: July 4, 2021 (Sunday)
Slot Time: 1.30 PM
Place: Hyderabad VAC

- Travelled via Metro to reach Rasoolpura Metro Station (avoiding traffic and parking issues basically). 
- *Don't blindly follow Google Maps to reach VAC center* (It shows the main entrance which is not open right now. We enter through back gate. There was Gowra Trinity building there (landmark) and you will find people waiting for their OFC.
- Hardly 5 min walk from Rasoolpura Metro Station
- Documents required: Passport, DS-160 confirmation, and appointment confirmation printout.
- They were allowing 15-20 mins before your slot time, also don't carry sanitizers inside. Else you have to put it somewhere at your own risk!
- Simple process, will take about 20 mins. Just follow their instructions.
- Reached there at 12:50 PM, waited for about 20 mins, and process was completed by 1:50 PM.
- You will get a sticker attached to your passport, and also some stampings on DS-160 page. These two are required for interview.

*VISA Interview Experience*
- Before you enter the gate, you will be asked to show the passport (with sticker), DS-160 page (after OFC one) and appointment confirmation page.
- After that you will have to remove your mask so that your photo on passport can be matched.
- There will be a security check after you enter, wherein you will have to keep your folder, passport, DS-160, and appointment confirmation page. You will have to remove your belt if you wear any, and have to keep any metallic things (coins) in the tray. Much like airport security check.
- Later you will be directed to the counters.

Girl in front of me was also approved, so much relieving tbh!

VO - You have completed your undergrad in which subject ? 

Me - I have completed my undergrad and my post grad in Biotechnology. 

VO - Oh, wait. You are already Masters. So why second masters ? Why MBA ? ( Of course he was going to ask me this. ) 

Me -  Even though my post graduation is in Biotechnology, my work experience connects well with my future goals. Having acquired work experience at the grassroots level, I am targeting the position of marketing manager. An MBA at this point in my career will give me a competitive advantage over my peers and allow me to grow to higher levels.  I would also learn about various facets of business like finance, strategy, marketing and team building.. I want to specialise in Marketing Anaytics with MBA degree because it will prepare me for inevitable digitalisation in marketing sector and give me the ability to transition between industries. ( Cuts me off and quite satisfied - I could understand that from his facial expressions. Also, maintained eye contact throughout ) 

VO - Who is sponsoring you ?

Me - My parents. 

VO - Where does your father work and his salary? (types something ) 

Me - Told

VO - Place your right hand fingers on the scanner. Now place your left hand fingers on the scanner. 

Me - did 

VO - All good. Thank you..your visa is approved! Passed me the white slip. 

Me - Thank you very much sir.

Suggestions based on my experience : 
1. Keep a natural flow of the answers you are delivering.

2. Do not avoid eye contact. If you keep a good eye contact, it displays confidence.

VO: Please pass me your I20 as well.
Me: Oh sorry. (Passed my I20)
VO: So let's start by taking your fingerprints. Please place your left hand four fingers on the scanner.
Me: (Placed)
VO: So why are you going to Uni at Buffalo?
Me: Sir because University at Buffalo offers a Software and Information system specialization which I am particularly interested in.
VO: How will you apply this specialization in your career?
Me: My father has a printing and packaging industry and I want to digitalize it as much as possible by making softwares for it. This is why I am interested in this specialization as I will be able to gain the required skills to make softwares.
VO: So how are you going to fund your education?
Me: My uncle (mentioned his name) who lives in the US has offered to sponsor me. (Stopped here for him to ask what he does. He was busy typing so decided to tell him anyways because I knew he would not be satisfied by this much.). He is a retired businessman who sold his company for XX dollars in 20xx. (Didn't ask for any proof of this).
VO: Sounds good. Your visa has been approved. Welcome to the United States. Abide by the quarantine rules when you reach.
Me: Thank you very much sir. Have a nice day.

Honestly, I was very nervous while standing in the queue before the interview but it all went away as soon as I committed my first mess up (passing SEVIS Receipt instead of I20). Probably because at this point I decided to focus all my attention to listen to what he was saying so that I could understand the question completely before I started answering it. Don't worry too much. Just listen to the question, understand it and then answer to the point. No need to introduce terminology which becomes harder to explain if they happen to ask about it. They are not going to complicate your interview if you don't give them a chance. So with full confidence just go for it and treat it as a conversation rather than an interview and you will get your visa.

VO: Florida..so tell me about your course
Me: It's a 30 credit course and requires 4/6 core courses. 6 credits can be taken outside the dept..(etc).
VO: What's your specialization?
Me: Data Science (was thinking of adding something but I couldn't recollect any of my keywords) 
*Awkward silence for 5 seconds*
VO: Okay, why Data Science?
Me: I've always been driven towards DS(was wondering where this was headed, fumbled a bit) *few secs awkward silence again*. Data Science has progressed a lot over the last decade and has become an integral part behind the working of applications we use everyday..well, everything is data driven these days. (No response from him yet so I continued..) So, Data Science specialization along with a combination of Machine Learning courses is what I'm currently looking at, at UF. 
VO: What do you plan to do after graduation? 
Me: I'll come back to India. I'd like to work with some rapidly growing organisations here, like CRED, Swiggy..(awkward silence), CRED(🤦🤦🤦), *trying to make up for it* and I have a few others in mind 🤡(at this point I thought it was going to be a reject. Why wouldn't I tell him If I already had them in mind) 
VO: That's fine. Any siblings? 
Me: Yeah I have a brother. He's currently doing an MBA.
VO: In the U..*interrupts*

Some pointers: 

1. If you are at the Mumbai consulate, please arrive only 15 minutes prior to ypur apointment time. It was raining heavily today, and they do not let you in early. In spite of having umbrellas, rains in Mumbai are heavy, and I even saw someone's documents falling out of the file and getting wet. It's not a risk worth taking. 

2. Dress formal/informal enough to feel confident. 

3. The bald guy was at counter 33. Though he was approving everyone, there were a lot of unnecessary questions he was asking (e.g. why they had come to Mumbai when it was not the nearest consulate for them). Not to worry though, as he was approving all visas.

Vo: *puts away my passport while I was speaking so now I'm smiling because I felt like I made it*
Vo: That sounds more than adequate for what is needed for your education. Congratulations, your visa has been approved. 
Me: That's great to hear, have a great day.
Vo: Likewise.

The Vo in this case was grilling everyone, there was another early 30s Vo who was approving visas left right without asking anything. My advice would be just like everyone else. Don't sound nervous, they feel like something's not right, just stay on point and answer the question, it's not an interview it's a conversation. My Vo had rejected 1 ahead of me and 2 he grilled them a lot. But I felt that was because they were nervous and their voice was breaking. It's ok to take pauses, you don't have to answer in one complete sentence. And there is absolutely no need for you to be nervous. If you miss an answer they'll ask again. So don't treat it like a interview, just simple conversation.

OFC: New delhi(6/7/21) 9:30 am
VI:New delhi(7/7/21) 11.40 am

OFC experience

It was in shivaji metro station. After security check I had to go two floors down. They allow you phone inside. We just have to switch off the phone before entering. The whole process is smooth. We have to scan the fingers and they will take photo. (At OFC the officer asked me to carry a 2x2 inch photo with white background for VI. However, in VI nobody asked me the photo hence it has no use. I think sometime for few people photo might not load at VI, they might have asked me to take photo as a precaution.) At OFC they will check DS 160 and paste a label behind passport. We have to take this OFC sheet to VI. I reached around 1 hour before OFC. In delhi it is first come first serve rule I think. They let me inside and after a brief time in the que I went inside. Overall ofc is smooth.

VI experience

I reached the consulate by 10:40 am. 1 hour before the VI. OLA will drop you near the gate. At the opposite side of the road there is a security checking. We have to submit our phone there in q locker(it costs 50 rs).they immediately allowed me to go to the opposite side of the road 
At opposite side they will scan the sticker behind passport. 
After that you have to undergo a security check again. They will allow belt, analog watch, water bottle etc. After checking. Dress code can be anything. I have seen lot of people with formals as well as casuals and semi casuals. It won't matter.

After the security check they will ask as to sit in rows of 5. Each row will be called at once and we will go inside. Inside they asked us to take out passport, i20 and SEVIS ( that's all!!)
Then we will go to a counter and they will check the details.
After that they will ask you to wait infront of counters. There was 6/7 counters. I got the first counter( it was an Indian American lady)
We have to stand in a que. Three people will be in the que infront of the counter. 

Interview experience
Program: MS mechanical engineering, Texas A&M

VO:Good morning. Pass me i20,passport and SEVIS fee receipt

Me: good morning ma'am. Here it is

VO: (looked at the i20 and saw the funding details.) How are you going to fund your studies

Me: I am getting a fellowship from the college worth $10000 and for the remaining amount I am taking the combined savings of my brother, sister in law and my parents. The savings all together include 46 lakhs. And I have immovable assets worth 1.2 Cr

VO: What does your brother and sister in law do?

Me: they both are surgeons based in Delhi.

(VO was typing throughout the time)

VO: your visa is approved! Please collect passport later ( I was actually surprised. The whole thing went very fast and she asked me only two question)

PS:
I prepared a lot for answering why us, why this program etc. But VI was so chill.
My loan was not approved at the time of VI. Hence I was little worried, however VO didn't enquire anything about loan or other financial documents. In fact she asked only i20,SEVIS and passport.


Tips: Overall be confident and maintain eye contact. I have not seen any reject in any near by counters also.

Tips:
Bald guy is on 33. If you get him please please answer to the point. If you say any word up or down, he really grills. I hope no one has a previous reject but if you'll do, and you get the bald guy, be prepared for questions like, why did you change your university and he does not want our standard answers there. Also, if you have travelled from cities which have consulates to Mumbai, he maybe like why din't you go to that consulate itself.

The guy who interviewed me was pretty chilled. Till the time your finances are strong he does not say anything. Also, its ok to stammer a bit. I did. If you get the guy who interviewed me and you don't answer the university question confidentially, he might grill you. He grilled a girl(heard when I was waiting in line), but she did answer all his remaining questions correctly, so he approved her. He rejected a guy  who stood a person ahead of me. I guess university wasin't that reputed. 

Please carry umbrellas if you'll are going to Mumbai. It rains any time and when it rains, it rains heavily.

Was a very chill interview. The guy before me was going for MS in Data Science and was asked the generic Why this degree, what's your plan, etc. questions so I assumed I would definitely be asked a lot of questions. The environment is pretty relaxed. Sharing my experience because there are very few posts on Second Master's and I hope this helps someone who's in my shoes. All the best! :)

Chennai Vac has locker facilities to keep your stuff.But i didnt see any at consulate, its just on signal so better keep your stuff like phone and smartwatch at your hotel. 
the interview and biometrics last 1-2 min avg but the process of waiting in queue and sitting will take long (45 mins) so be prepared  physically and mentally. 
They didnt ask about parents salary and all but drilled me about course so be prepared for that  too. 
Also i got  a bit nervous so couldnt greet her, was just answering like a robot so its fine just know your answers well.

University - The University of Texas at Dallas
Interview duration - 20-30 seconds or maybe hardly a minute 

We were asked to go into the consulate for security scan and was asked to remove everything including shoe and watch. The security checked files, folders and then asked me to proceed.

Then, We were sent inside the waiting room at 8.55-9.00 I think we're our passport, DS 160 was checked and verified. 

And then when we were sent into the interview hall. As soon as I entered, I went blank and forgot everything that I had prepared looking at the counters and VO.
 
Counter 4,5,6 were open but when the person in front of my was about to go, the VO in counter 5 closed the blinds. 

Then, I stepped forward to be the next person in line for interview, asusual being blank. 

Post reading telegram messages, I was hoping I don't get the Chinese VO, but I think he was made for me  :P

He waved and asked me to step forward and pass my passport, i20 and sevis fee. 
He was not able to scan my DS 160 so sent me to counter No.2
The lady in counter No.2 scanned and said it's good to go, please proceed. 

Came back and stood in line hoping I would get the American VO atleast this time. 
But like I said, I think he was made for me. 
He looked at me and signalled to come forward 

Me : Well, hello again
VO : Hello, welcome back. I'll need the same docs again. 

Passed them

 VO : So let's scan them and see this time. 
Luckily it scanned after 2 tried. 

VO : So tell me what are you going for. 
Me : I am going to pursue my Master's in Finance at UTD. 

Silence for good 30 seconds as he was typing something, meanwhile my mind voice was contemplating between continuing to tell my specialization or just keep quiet. And when I decided to speak- 
http://t.me/f1interviewreviews
VO : Cool, so what did you do your undergraduate in? 
Me : I finished my Bachelor's of Commerce from SRM.

VO : When did you graduate ?
Me : 2017

VO : And since then have you been working? 
Me : Yes I worked as an Audit Analyst with KPMG and continued to work with Zomato for the past 3 years. 

VO : ooohh, zomato? (Raises eyebrows)
Me : Yes.

VO : So tell me why continue to study after working for 4 years?
Me : Through my work ex I have known the outline of how finance works in a  company, now I'd like to gain more knowledge about the same and this course would help me move forward in my career ( though, I wanted to say cuz I didn't want to work anymore and go to US :p)

VO : Cool, and how are you planning your funding?
Me : I have a loan sanctioned for 38 lakh and apart from that my parents are sponsoring. 

VO : And what do they do? 
Me : My father is a businessman and my mother is a Central government employee.

She asked me for the passport, and I greeted her with a 'Good Morning' while handing it over, and she smiled and responded the same. Then she asked me to lower my mask (identity check) and scanned my fingerprints. And finally asked me to place the sevis fee and i20 in the space below the counter. 

VO: Which University will you be going to?
Me: I will be going to New Jersey Institute of Technology to pursue my master's in Computer Engineering.

VO: Any other admits? 
Me: I got an admit from San Francisco State University.

VO: Why did you choose NJIT over the other one?
(This was the only question where she closely observed my response, for the other questions she was just looking at the screen)
Me: Well, NJIT offered a better curriculum and has a wide range of electives which suits my interest. Also I had a chance to do some research about the faculty and I came across Prof....... His area of research coincides with my field of interest and studying under him would definitely help me gain the in-depth knowledge I'm looking for.

VO: How are you planning to fund your studies? ( Checked my i20 as I was replying)
Me: I have been sanctioned an education loan by the Indian Bank for 40L and my parents have deposits worth Rs<>. All of these sum up to around $<>..

Me: I'll return to India and apply for the post of Embedded Systems Engineer at '...so so companies' ...

VO: Petroleum Consultant is not a job title. What is his job title?

Me: Rig Manager 

VO: What is his annual income?

Me: 1Cr. I also have liquid savings and an FD worth..

VO: *cuts me off as it to say ‘no need’*

VO: What was your major?

Me: I studied Communication with a focus on Business Management and Econ

VO: Ok so now you want to pursue a master’s in Finance? Why the sudden change of stream?

Me: It’s not so much a change of stream. Its actually more or a transition. I also have a MS in Management from Cranfield University in the UK, so my undergrad and post grad education so far have given me a holistic academic insight into the inner workings of different business processes and how they homogeneously exist to make an organization tick. Now I want to zone in on a micro lv. and specialize in Finance *VO kept nodding and looking me in the eye the whole time*

VO: Ok so why a second masters in Finance now?
http://t.me/f1interviewreviews
Me: I want to specialize in Finance so I can pursue a career as a Financial Analyst in Corp. Finance. I did consider the traditional MBA route, however given my existing masters degree, the MBA would have been repetitive and more time consuming. 

VO: How is the MBA more time consuming?

Me: An average MBA takes two years. Both my masters combined will take 18months. 

*At this point he seemed a little perplexed so I was a little nervous, but eventually he went Oh, Ok*

VO: Place your right four fingers on the scanner. 

VO: Okay, YOUR VISA IS APPROVED. 

Me: Thank you. *and quickly left before he changed his mind* 

PS: Despite getting the bald guy I knew I would be interrogated over my second masters degree so I had prepared for that.

Only a few rejections over the most basic things: 

1. Not being able to explain how bachelors is relevant to masters.

2. Not knowing the source of their savings.

3. Poorly ranked universities with no explanation as to exactly why they selected said school over others. 

Make sure you prepare well for the basic questions, answer them in calm conversational manner and you will easily get an approval!

Me : (I had prepared for this question since I knew it may be confusing to understand) It is an LLM program only but for foreign lawyers and especially tailored for Foreign trained lawyers like me.

Me: 7 in total. Boston College, NEU, PennState, UIUC,USC and UC Davis.
The moment I said UC Davis he looked at me (he was looking at the screen while I was answering) and said that he’s an alumni of UC Davis and was happy that I applied to the school.

A bit of background on my case: I have been living in the US for the past 6 years on an H-4 visa, which expired just after I completed my undergrad in the US in December 2020. I also have a valid B1/B2 (10-year tourist) visa. Since both my parents and my sibling live in the US (sibling has a green card), proving ties to my home country (India) was crucial in my case. Also, I do not have much work experience to point to either, since I only graduated ~7 months ago.

The VO was an American lady in her late-20s/early 30s. She was extremely chill; I believe Delhi’s own version of the legendary bald guy from Mumbai. She approved 5 candidates before me, also with relatively short interviews.

Me: Good afternoon!
Vo: Good afternoon, pass me your I-20, DS-160 confirmation and passport please.
Vo: Which university are you going to?
Me: Washington University at St. Louis. 
Vo: Got it. *reads I-20* and you’re going for your MBA?
Me: Yes.
Vo: You’ve studied in Canada? (I lived in Canada for a year)
Me: Yes, my 10th grade was in Canada.
Vo: And you’ve lived in the US already too?
Me: Yes, I was in the US for my 11th and 12th grade, as well as undergrad.
Vo: Where did you go for your undergrad?
Me: I went to UNC Chapel Hill
Vo: Oh nice! And how do you plan to sponsor yourself for your MBA?
Me: I have a scholarship of $xxx and for the rest my dad is sponsoring me. He has liquid fixed deposits of INR xxx lakhs. 
Vo: Gotcha *picks up passport and places it on the table of approved passports on the side*
Me: *Holds in a squeal of joy and relief*
Vo: I’m approving your visa, please put your right hand, four fingers on the scanner. Be sure to follow quarantine guidelines. 
Me: Thank you so much! Have a good day.
Vo: Thank you, you too!

A few notes/pieces of advice:
1. Just be confident and relaxed. I was waiting for about 15-20 mins, and I probably saw at least 15 candidates across all the VO counters get approved in front of me. 
2. Take ALL documents you think they can possibly ask you for. While most interviews are chill, I did see one or two candidates being asked for things like their CV, or experience certificates. It is best to be extra prepared.
3. You can go early to the consulate and they’ll let you in. My interview was in the afternoon, around lunch time, so they did make us wait outside for 15-20 minutes, but eventually let us all in well before our scheduled interview times. 
4. They first check that you have your main documents (Passport, SEVIS payment slip, I-20 and DS-160 confirmation), and then put you in line to interview with a VO. 
5. At the Delhi consulate, there is a place to leave your bag and phone (they charge INR50 per item). You can take a binder or file with your documents in it, but it will be checked by security first.

Feel free to comment any questions!

Questions:
VO asked for passport, I20, and SEVIS (I couldn't understand what he said, so asked him to repeat, but I knew he would ask these documents only, so anyway I forwarded my documents before he could repeat).
VO: Why this program?
Ans: Told about my research (specifying in PhD research lab matters the most and my long term goal to come back and work here), and student community there.
VO: Your VISA is approved, please abide by quarantine rules. Have a wonderful time in US.
Ans: *Smiling* Thank you!

Told he wanted to quickly verify me and asked me to place my right hand 4 fingers. (I think there was some technical problems at the end so I asked if everything's alright, he said he is just going through some features (I don't know what he meant)).


P.S. I was a bit nervous, not exactly nervous, a bit tired because of all the travel and scorching heat in Delhi, so was a bit shaky in between (plus I hadn't prepared any answers as I knew it really doesn't matter, just blabber anything with confidence), but was alright after few words. Anyway, it is going to be fine, specifically for PhD students, so just relax and focus on other important stuffs.

Tips 
1. Talking to fellow applicants outside the counsulate helped me stay calm before going in.
2. We just need to be confident, clear and calm while replying.
3. Being on time and keeping all the documents in the folder ( although Nothing besides the passport and i20 was asked ) helped me gain confidence and kept me relaxed.
4. Every time, I felt stressed,  I kept thinking to myself that they want to approve my visa and the system is designed to make us get approvals.

My Tips: 
Dress in formals, though it's not compulsory but it certainly creates an impact as they see you from top to bottom while you approach the counter and you also feel confident from inside being in formals (personal feeling)

It's more of a conversation then interview keep it light
If you know about your profile, about yourself and have prepared for University questions it should be a cake walk.

I am more than happy to help if anyone of you have any questions 

This group did help lot kudos to the admin 

Thanks a lot to everyone for taking the time and writing their experiences

PS- As I said it's more of a conversation don't be nervous almost 95% of the people are getting approved

Of those rejected either got too nervous and unable to answer 
Or have some really low ranked University which makes them potential immigrant as per VO

Date: 1st July
Time:12:30 PM

Documents required: Passport, DS-160, Appointment Confirmation Only

I reached around 12:10 as I planned my drive accordingly 

The VAC is located on the Shivaji Airport Metro Station 
It is 2 floors down 

My Experience:
As I reached 20 mins before they allowed me directly 
As soon as you step in you have to go through the security check 

They allow your phone's, wallets, watches, keys to be carried as it's combined Metro and VAC security check 

Then you are made to go 2 floors down and their as per your slot you will have to stand in the queue 
Your Passport, DS-160 and Appointment confirmation will be checked and you will be guided to the next window 

Here they will place the white tag on your passport and then you can go inside after temperature check and sanitzing your hand 

You go through one more security check here you are asked to switch off your phone's and proceed 

You will be standing in queue again and with respect to counter clearance you will be called ahead 
Asked some details (Name , DOB) from passport to cross check and finally they will take your photographs and biometrics 

Some tweaks in your position left right side ways which may make you concious for your photograph lol
Left hand Right Hand and both the Thumbs

Overall the process is very smooth and you don't have to worry 
Just enjoy the AC after waiting in ridiculous Delhi Heat and it will be over within 15 mins

Once done with security check here you will be asked to cross the road and keep your passport only handy

They will check your passport and then you proceed to the main security check 

You will have to remove your belt (if you are wearing any), keep your wallet in tray and all the documents 

Then you proceed to the first hall where they generally make you wait but as our slot was early so not much students were there so they directly let us inside the main hall 

Here you will be asked to keep your above mentioned documents handy they check it and finally you proceed to the next hall and sit while your wait to come

Tips:
1) For kolkata reaching early wouldn't get your interview done faster. Timing was strictly followed. Go 30 mins before your interview. You should be well dressed 
2) Do no take any photo, video near the consulate. I repeat do not take any photos or videos. You'll be in deep trouble. Someone there did. I saw him being dragged in by security. Poor guy. Since mobile is anyways not allowed, I'd suggest you leave your mobile in the hotel itself. Or there's a small shop outside consulate that keeps phones for a minimal price. 


VO is pretty helpful and very encouraging. It's a simple interview where they want to know if you have funded properly or not and also they are checking if you are aware of your course and subjects. That's all. Peace!

Vo: Ok, i am approving your visa. Place your right hand 4 fingers. 
Me : I placed and said Thank you. Have a nice day 
Vo: you too

The unexpected incident: I was by myself and thought that the Chennai consulate would have a locker facility to keep my phone or they would allow the phone inside after its switched off... so I carried my phone with me as I thought I would need it to book a cab for my return trip. But they don't allow you inside even with your phone switched off and also they don't have a locker facility at this point (Idk whether such a facility existed before the lockdown). Then the security guard suggested me to give my phone to the Autowalas who are taking advantage of such opportunities and having a make-shift locker system in which such items are kept in one of the autos with a person sitting in it. Initially when I deposited the phone to them, they asked me to give whatever amount I can happily. Then when I came back they made me sit in an auto and 3-4 autowalas surrounded me and started to demand $100...I said I don't have any dollars on me. I can give you Rs. 1000...which was way below their expectation of $100...so those 3-4 guys started to put more pressure on me to give them more than that. I had to reach out my pocket and I had around Rs. 3000 in 500 rupee notes which I had to give them and sajd that I dont have any more on me... Then only they let me go. And then one of the autowalas asks me ""Are you happy""? I said Ya but he also knows that I must have been swearing internally 😅 

Take home message: If anybody is not there to accompany you, then don't take your phone to the Chennai consulate... consider catching a auto to your home/hotel instead of booking a cab. I hope the Chennai consulate addresses this issue since some of the other consulates seem to already have such a facility in place. 

Other tips: I went to the consulate like an hour before and I had to stand outside in the hot and sweaty Chennai weather until they let me in around my slot time of 11 am so reaching there half an hour or so before should be good and having an umbrella might be useful. As someone mentioned before as well, Its not FCFS in chennai consulate. 

Interview tips: Think in advance of the answers for the general questions and then keep calm, have fun. Enjoy the process and share your experience :)

Visa OFC
Date - 27 June 2021
Place - New Delhi
Appointment Time - 1:30 pm
In Time - 1:00 pm
Out Time - 1:15 pm

In Delhi, OFC takes place at *Shivaji Stadium Metro Station*. Guards allowed me a entry 30 minutes earlier to appointment. Kept my all documents for checking after entering and then security check was done.
Visa Office is down 2 floors, so I took escalator. There was already a small queue with all covid protocols followed. Line moved very quickly and came my number. There were 4-5 windows.
First window asked me for passport, DS-160 confirmation and appointment confirmation. Then 4th window asked me for passport and DS-160 confirmation and gave me token along with sticker on passport.
Then guard allowed me to enter in a room. In that room again security check took place. After that he pointed me towards a queue, there was only one guy standing in front of me.
Then one guard asked me to move to one window, where he asked me for *Passport*, *DS-160 Confirmation* and *Appointment Confirmation*. He gave me a stamp on DS-160 confirmation and then told me that your OFC is completed please bring your passport on your interview. I moved towards exit and then took escalator to take exit from metro station.
TIPS - 1. Carry your Passport, DS-160 Confirmation and Appointment Confirmation in a transparent file.
2. Come 1 hour early, some people got their OFC done before 45 min of their appointment.

Reached U.S. Embassy at 1:00 pm, there is a waiting area outside the embassy. Locker system is also available at the same area. There was lunch break going on when we reached. Then at 1:20 pm Guard announced those who have 1:30 and 1:40 appointment please make a queue. Then again after 5 min he asked everyone who has appointment till 2:30 to stand in queue.
In waiting area security check took place one by one according to queue. Then I crossed the road to reach the place where ""Non-Immigrant Visa"" was written. There they asked for *Passport* and scanned it. Then I entered Consular Building. Again security and document check took place. Then there was a long corridor to reach a door.
After entering there were windows which asked me for *Passport*, *Sevis Fee* and *I-20*. Then I was moved to a waiting area. We can see from there, officers and people giving interviews. After 15 minutes came my turn, till that time I saw everyone's Visa got approved so I was confident.
VO - Please place your left hand fingers for scanning.
Me - Placed.
VO - Please pass me your passport and I-20.
Me - Here it is Sir. (Just realized I did not wished him). Sir Good Afternoon (No Response so I thought that due to mask I was not audible so pushed mask down).
VO - Please put your mask up.
(I got little worried).
VO - So, why Stony Brook University? (He was not audible)
Me - Pardon Sir.
VO - Why Stony Brook University?
Me - Primary reason for selecting Stony Brook University is my Professor Advisor Dr. ###. (He stopped typing and looked at me with a very concentration). (I kept my eye contact with him). He has been doing great research in Fracture Mechanics. Secondly, SBU is one the reputed university for Mechanical Engineering in U.S. and the kind of expertise in Fracture Mechanics like Prof. #### and Prof. #### will help me to achieve my interest.
VO - What is Fracture Mechanics?
Me - It is concerned with mechanics of solids with cracks. It deals with propagation and prediction of cracks. For examples if there is crack in a bridge there are certain parameters used to indicate the severity of the crack to prevent future catastrophic failure.

* He's not maintaining eye contact
* Counter 29 VO is a chilled guy in his early 20's and he has lots of patience to listen to what you are saying.

VO was a bald guy, maybe mid thirties with a very cheerful disposition.

VO: Hello, hope you're doing well!
Me: Good morning sir, yes I am, hope you are as well.

VO: I just need your passport for now (I had passport and other documents like SEVIS, I20 etc. ready in my hand.)

Me:  Thank you sir, have a great day!
VO: Thank you, you too! (cheerily waved me off.)

Didn't see a lot of rejections when I was there, my takeaway from this was how confident you are matters more than anything, they were approving visas very quickly for some people and taking a few minutes for others.

Appointment: 9:10, completed by 9:30

Felt like almost pre covid level crowds out on the road. I reached early, but they let me in only at my appointment time.

Four counters were functional.

VO took a break to drink water, so I promptly drop my passport and I20 in the drop space.

VO: Thank you so much. How are you?

Me: I am good, thank you! How are you doing?

VO: Good, thanks for asking.

He tries to scan my passport, but the scanner doesn't detect it. He tried atleast 5 times. 

VO: Okay, so, you are going to pursue Computational Science?

Me: No Sir, the course is actually called Master in Interdisciplinary Data Science. I would be pursuing this from Duke University's Graduate School.

VO: Okay great. What does your father do?

Me: He is a retired professional.

VO: When you say professional, what kind of professional?

I am about to speak, then he interrupts and continues.

VO: You see, I have to make sure you are in a strong financial position. Duke is a very expensive school. So I need to understand your finances well.

Me: Oh, sure. My father retired as the head of the state electricity board. The total savings my parents have across their bank accounts and various liquid assets amounts to xxx. I also have some personal savings...

VO, interrupts: Okay, got it! Your visa is approved. Congratulations on your admission, Duke is a very good school.

Me: Thanks a ton! Have a good rest of the day!

I am starting to walk away, suddenly 3-4 people motion towards me to go back. I turn back and hear my name called again by the VO. I run to him.

VO: Sorry about that. It seems the scanner didn't record your fingerprints correctly. Please place your right 4 fingers on the scanner.

VO: Done, thanks!

Tip : Well rounded answers in 2-3 sentences are key. I fumbled a bit with my dad being retired,  and he was kind enough to coax the required details out of me.

Keep your I20 and SEVIS id handy while waiting. You can see many other students there. Most of the students were getting their visa approved. 

I waited in a queue for almost half an hour.

4 sections were opened. 
I was sent to the first Indian American guy. He was approving visa quickly than others. I noticed it while I was waiting for my turn😅, can't help. 

I greeted him, and he asked me for passport and i20. 
Overall, it was a comfortable environment. As soon as he asked my fingerprint scan and passport, he stood to go somewhere and asked me to wait.
I was about to get nervous, but I kept myself calm. 
Later I noticed he came with a filled water bottle😅. I told myself again to chill.

Post that, I was asked the following questions, 
1. Why do you want to visit US?
2. Where are you working at present? 
3. What have you done post your bachelor's?
4. How are you going to fund your education?
5. What does your father do?
6. Do you have any family member in US? 

After this, he placed my passport to a stack full of passport. I knew I got in😅 and then after 4-5 sec, he told me your visa is approved. 

I didn't feel anything at first. I was like they are literally there for approving visa only. I felt ecstatic after realising this part is done🤩.

Tip:

Reach there just 1 hour before, you will thank me later. 
Keep calm. I imagined Lee min ho smiling 🤣 to kill my anxiety. 
Practise thoroughly to give your answers. There was one American VO. He was asking more questions. One of the students hesitated and stammered, and I was like shit will he get angry or dubious. He gave him extra time.

And to my surprise all 4 VOs were friendly and that tensed guy got in🖖🏼. So yeah, just give your answers calmly and practice to gain more confidence.

VAC experience :
They let you in on time, not before. If you are early then be prepared to wait. No facility to store phones. Went on first floor, there is a counter where they will ask for passport, appointment confirmation and ds-160 confirmation. After verifying, was asked to proceed further inside. Was asked to go to a counter where the person took my passport and ds-160, photograph and fingerprints were taken.
At VAC Mumbai,the locker condition is pretty expensive, they charge almost Rs 600/500 for keeping your things in the locker. Hence its better you take someone along with you. (Allowed - Folder, Wallet, Analogue watch, Umbrella) Electronic devices strictly not allowed.

Few documents were checked before I met VO - I20, latest passport and sevis fee. 

Me: Good Morning officer!

Vo: (Types for 15-20 secs) You have b1/b2 visa?
Me: Yes.
Vo: (Again types for almost a minute, keeps my passportin the wrack on the side) You work at Accenture?
Me: Yes
Vo: (types for 5-10 secs) Congratulations! Your visa is approved. 
Me: (Wanted to ask, ho gaya? But stopped) Thank you very much, have a great day. 

Prepared so much, so much hype and approved in just 2 'yes'. There is a lot of nervous tension in the atmosphere, avoid looking at such people and keep your cool. Their mic is very bad, it was very hard to listen. A girl 2 places ahead seemed to have been rejected but don't know exactly since I was avoiding to listen to people ahead of me.

Inside consulate around 9:15
Waited for 25mins in waiting area.

Waited 10mins inside interview area before my number came.

Relevant info: 
Bald guy counter 33 - wasn't in good mood at all today. He roasted 2 people while I was in line. 
From what I overheard - ""sir please listen to the question carefully and then answer. I am asking one thing and you are answering something else."" He kinda got irritated with few candidates coz due to nervousness they were telling him the whole story and not the main point that he asked. He also told this guy- ""I don't want to see your documents just answer me  in one simple sentence. "" 
P.S. - He approved this guy's visa after the candidate calmed himself and gave clear answers.

Another guy was from Andra Pradesh (overheard conversation) and bald guy was questioning him a lot and was pissed a bit with him. He asked him about some proof regarding his living/belongingness to the town in Andra Pradesh he told VO about.  But I think he dint have anything to prove. Not sure about his result.

Then came my turn, counter 31. I was kinda glad that I dint get legendary bald guy. 😄

VO: good morning.
Me: good morning sir

VO: give me passport and i20
Me: gave documents

VO: So for which course are you going?
Me: master's in computer science sir. 

VO: tell me about your undergraduation?
Me: sir I did computer engineering from Pune University and graduated with a GPA of 8.83. (He was kinda impressed here. Gave me very positive vibes.)

VO: how many schools did you apply to?
Me: I applied to 6 colleges sir.

VO: How many admits and name them.
Me: sir I got admits from UT Arlington, UT Dallas, UC riverside.

VO: what are your plans after graduation?
Me: sir I will move back to India and would like to work in big IT firms like reliance or tcs.

VO: how are you funding yourself?
Me: sir my father will be sponsoring me he has savings of  lakhs and I also have a sanctioned non-collateral of  lakhs.

After this VO turned around, took my documents and kept it besides a bundle of previous candidates documents. I got nervous and thought to myself why are you keeping my documents aside and not with other people. 😅 

But then he turned and gave me white slip and said your visa is approved, handed white slip and asked me to follow covid guidelines.



Suggestions:

To stay calm,

Give clear and concise answers (just talk guys , fumbling is fine but give them answers), 

Stay confident - nervousness is understandable but don't let it affect your communication.

I dressed in semi-formals (white shirt and blue jeans) , so suit yourself but dress smart and dapper.

Bald guy gave visa to many people today in 15-20 secs but there were a few with whom he got very irritated. So don't worry guys, he is still a legendary guy.

1. Do not go more than 1-1.5 hours ago. They make you wait on the other side of the road and the rain AND sunlight both can be problematic in mumbai.

2. Bullet point answer rocks.

3. While I was there, I did see one guy getting rejected at legendary counter 33 and I also saw that they ARE grilling some candidates, so full preparation is necessary.

4. Even the candidates they are grilling, it felt that they were actually given more time to prove themselves, so it was a good thing that they are not denying in rapid fire. Only approvals are in rapid fire.

5. Locker facility was there in consulate premises. They asked for only 50rs.

*VO types something. Goes through ds160 probably for a while, which felt forever to me*

VO: Your visa is approved! You'll get your passport within a week!

Me: Thank you sir! *Grab my stuff and run away*

Tips:
1) For kolkata reaching early wouldn't get your interview done faster. Timing was strictly followed. Go 45min before your interview. You should be good.
2) Do no take any photo, video near the consulate. I repeat do not take any photos or videos. You'll be in deep trouble. Someone there did. I saw him being dragged in by security. Poor guy. Since mobile is anyways not allowed, I'd suggest you leave your mobile in the hotel itself. Or there's a small shop outside consulate that keeps phones for a minimal price. 
3) As for your interview, anticipate questions and prepare beforehand. Don't lie. KISS - keep it simple silly. 


VI is pretty overhyped. It's a simple interview where they want to know if you're bonafide, you are aware of your course and can fund your Master's. That's all. Peace!

VI Experience 

Date: 1st July
Visa type: F-1. 
Northeastern Eastern University.

Thought got late for the appointment but reaching just before 20 mins doesn’t created any problem.

It’s an open space just in front of the embassy where people are made to stand for a security check and the people came to accompany you can wait here.
(Couldn’t find any locker facility and no documents were asked).

Next you cross the road and again made to stand in a line for passport verification.
(Wasn’t asked anything apart from passport here).

Again you stand in a queue and get to enter in a waiting room where they will make you sit in a row. There were approx 6 rows and they keep on sending each after approx 10 mins. (Washroom and Drinking water facilities are available here).

Next you get to enter the main office of embassy where you will be asked for your DS160, I20, SEVIs and passport.

After verification you finally get to enter the area where interviews takes place.
You are again made to sit in rows and they will direct one by one to each counters.

There are no closed or separate rooms for interviews, it happens in a big hall and you can hear people giving their answers.
(Approx 30-35 people will be there in the hall).

I was keenly observing each counter couldn’t weigh one over other, each counter was taking it’s own time depending upon the candidate. But just wanted to go to counter 19 as I was closely sitting to that one and saw everyone getting their visa approved.

Fortunately got to stand in the queue of counter 19. One person just standing in front of me was very nervous and fumbled giving each answer with not so good English accent but still got his visa approved.

So I feel they just check the credibility and genuineness.

My interview was quick with just three questions asked. Thought I would be nervous but I was super calm and gave each answer confidently.

Counter: 19 (Asian man with American accent in his late 20s)

VO: Pass me your Documents (SEVIS, I20, Passport).
Me: Passed.
VO: place your left hand four fingers on the scanner.
VO: Why US?
Me: To pursue my masters in Information Systems from Northeastern University.
VO: What have you been doing in India.
Me: Been working as an IT Analyst in TCS.
VO: What about funding?
Me: I have an educational loan of 35 lacs, got my own savings of 16 lacs and on top of it my parents have reserved 35 lacs from their savings for my education.
VO: congratulations your visa is approved have a great day!
Me: Thank you so much.!!
you too 😁

The office was empty so they took me in before time and it just took 20 mins.

VFS Global 2 floors down, as soon as you reach you can see VFSI booth, they will make you stand in a queue and directed towards counters, you will be visiting 2 counters.

On 1st counter show your DS160 and appointment letter, they will mark it and will direct you to the next counter.

On 2nd counter they will check your passport and put a sticker on it.

Next you will go for security check and then you’ll enter the area where your biometric and photo will be taken, they’ll ask for your passport, DS160 and appointment letter.

That’s it.... 

You are allowed to carry cell phone but no other Bluetooth device.

It’s an easy peasy nothing to worry about. Just be calm and fill your DS160 very carefully to avoid any confusion.
If details are clear then not much questions are asked.

VO – who is sponsoring you ?
Me – My parents

VO – What does your father do ?
Me – told

VO – What is his income?
Me – 10 lakhs per annum

VO – What are your savings?
Me – (I confused it with liquid assets) its 1.66 cr which is in the form of bank balance FDs…

VO – (Cutting me) what does your father actually do?
Me – As I told you he has a business and _

VO – (cutting me again) sir I’m asking what are your other sources of income?
Me – My father is a __ and his income is 10 lakhs per annum.
VO – Sir, you are repeating the same things again. Your income is too low as compared to this savings. Now tell me where has this much money come from. 
Me – (I was completely gripped with fear and couldn’t think of anything else) I’m sorry for that. But my father earns this much only. I think this salary is sufficient…….
VO – What does your mother do? 
Me – She is a ____ and she earns 10 lakhs too.
VO- I’m asking your again. This kind of salary is too less for someone to save so much. Just tell me where does this money come from? 
Me- (I was so gripped with fear I barely blurted out) Sir, this is all I know and I’m telling you’re the truth.
VO – Have you taken a loan?
Me- Yes, I have taken a loan of 60 lacs (my mistake it was 45 lacs). 
VO- When you have so much money then why are you taking the loan.
Me- So, that I would be easy……
VO- No, how would it be easy? If you already have so much savings then why did you take out a loan. (Almost banging his hand on the desk)
(By that time, I was sure that he has already rejected me)
Me – We have taken it so that my parents could pay it in proper installments.
VO – (starts typing and types for a long time and hands me all my documents along with section 214(b) form) I can’t give you the visa right now.

Please don't go very early guys or you would have to stand on the street for near about 30 to 45 minutes depending on your appointment time, just go half n hour early before the allotted time. And be confident when you speak because they try to judge you on your statement apart from that I just saw 2-3 people leaving with their passports apart from that most of the people got their Visa approved. And one more tip I was wearing complete formal outfit, don't go in with casuals it doesn't lay a good impression on the officers there, and trust me it will make you feel more confident.

Counter: didn't notice
VO: American Man, Semi Bald, Late 20s

VO- Hello, Good morning
ME- Good morning officer, 

VO- Please pass me your passport

ME- Did, while trying to adjust my papers

My file falls down with a *thud! Meanwhile, VO was asking for I20, and I was picking my file (I thought it is over for me now)
Anyways, I passed my I20 and SEVIS receipt. He kept looking at my I20 and typing continuously while making eye contact a few times.
VO- Tell me about your bachelors

ME- I did my bachelors in fashion technology from NIFT in 2018 with 8.4 GPA
VO-  year?

ME- 2018
VO- GPA?

ME- 8.4
VO- what are you doing since then?

ME- I worked as a management trainee with XX at their Jordan facility for a year, then I joined XX and I am working as a production merchandiser.
VO- As what?

ME- Production Merchandiser

VO- Curious* and maintained eye contact ..what do they do?
ME-  We coordinate the RM procurement, manufacturing, and launch process of a product.

VO- What do you want to do after masters?

ME- I want to come back and join a senior position at a big retail firm, named a few. And then I want to open my own consulting firm. (He maintained eye contact through this)

VO- This is an awful lot of money to spend on a design degree.

ME- It is not a design degree sir, it is about everything that happens after design.
VO- you mean the business aspect of it?

ME- Yes, the business side.

VO was typing and there was complete silence for almost a minute
VO- what do your parents do?

ME- both are central govt employees, my father is an engineer with xx and my mother is a teacher at xx

VO- Siblings?

ME- yes, I have a younger sister

VO- what is the annual income of your parents

ME- My father's annual income is 10lpa and monther's 11 LPA..so yeah total 21.
http://t.me/f1interviewreviews

VO- Typing..typing, and picked the green slip. I am approving your visa congratulations, have a nice stay in the US.

ME- Thank you so much sir, thanks a lot. took the slip and rushed out, could not believe getting approved after the way I performed.

P.S- I have an assistantship covering more than 90% of costs, no questions asked regarding that or remaining finances.
I have lived in Jordan for a year on a work visa, no questions about that either. (I was skeptical if they will find any issue)

My takeaways:
1. We should not call this an interview, rather just credential verification. I fumbled a hell lot, I gasped for air literally after every line because I was extremely nervous and sweating. What probably worked for me was that I was genuine. I did not prepare for the answers, told whatever came at the moment. It's basically about our career and I feel one should be able to explain about past and future without mugging. 
2.  I did carry a lot of docs, but what I feel is, it's more for your peace of mind. my interview was like a rapid-fire and there were so many people lining up, I don't think any VO has time to go through your financial docs and verify them. Even if we go through other's experiences I saw only one person in Delhi who was asked for UG Marksheet. What I mean to say is, do carry everything you feel can help your case, but don't freak out much. As long as you know everything, you should be fine.

For Chennai candidates:
1. No need to go in advance, even if you reach 5-10 mins before your slot it's fine. There was a big line, and we were let in batches, once inside the process was pretty fast, I didn't have cc to sit in the waiting room. 
2. They did not ask for any documents except- Appointment confirmation (At the security gate), Passport (Twice while checking in, once right before VI), Passport +I20 Asked by VO. No one checked my SEVIS receipt.

Me: Thank you officer. Take care.
Vo: You too :)


Interview went hardly a minute. Vo was looking at the I20 or was typing something most of the time. He typed everytime I spoke about financials.

There was a pin drop silence when I entered the room and I was able to hear others speaking. You can clearly hear the VO cos he will be speaking through a mike.

Everyone who came during my time slot got approved. Even those who stammered a lot to explain the financials part. It is pretty evident that the VOs are ready to approve you unless you give them a reason not to.

Majority of the focus is on the financials. 

I understand this process will be nerve breaking, it was for me as well especially due to the critical factors in my profile. But trust me guys, this time they are really into approving students and you don't need to fret much about this, unless you can't speak clearly or your case isn't genuine.

Here's how the interview went---

Me:Good morning sir.

VO: Completely ignores

VO:Please pass your I20 and Passport

Me: Still  murmuring Good morning sir(Passed the documents)

VO: Hello, Good morning to you as well (cheerfully). So you are going to NYU, why did you choose NYU?

Me:  Told (spoke about 3 points, VO nodded and agreed on all)

VO: Great! Which course are going for ?

Me : Masters in Computer Engineering

VO: Any particular specialisation or subject you are looking for?

Me: Yes sir. I am quite interested in Machine learning and its applications.

VO: Why Machine learning?

Me: Told him something related to ML and its different applications and how everything in tech is moving towards AI and ML.

VO: What do you plan to do after your graduation?

Me: Since my parents live here i plan to come back here in India and work at some MNC as an ML engineer.

VO: Great, so do you have any siblings?

Me: Yes I do, i have an elder brother

VO: Where is he ?

Me: So he's in New York, he works as Sr. Manager at American Express Manhattan Headquarters.

VO: So is he on visa or has he taken PR( permanent residence)?

Me: He's on H1B visa 

VO: Oh okay, so what about your fundings?

Me: So along with the scholarship that I have, i am myself having a savings of about XX lakh rupees , also my parents are helping me, they have movable assets of about YY lakh and immovable asset of about ZZ crores. I have a CA approved net worth certificate if you would like to have a look.
http://t.me/f1interviewreviews

VO: No its absolutely fine, let me check something (probably sees my ds160)

VO: So have you ever been to US?

Me: Yeah once, this  jan end mid feb only, visited my brother it was kind of a family trip.

VO: Thats nice (still checking his computer)

*Then he finally said the golden words and i forgot all the stress, pain and sleepless nights i had to go through to get a visa appointment slot *

VO: okay , so your visa has been approved, have a nice time at New York, also be careful of the quarantine rule and dont enter US atleast 30 days before your scheduled classses. Thank you have a good day, NEXT one please.

 Me: Thanks a lot sir

Tip: 
For VI: 
Try reaching as early as possible, they are hardly checking the scheduled slot time. I had my slot at 10 am, i reached the embassy at around 9 and realized they had already allowed till 10:30 am. So the person who had his slot at 11 was standing next to someone who had at 9:30. There is a lot of rush more than 100 applicants i could see(including the waiting ones). Again this is strictly for Delhi embassy. Another tip, just state the honest answers and reasons, worked in my case. The guy before me, his visa got rejected as he could not justify what he was saying.

For slot booking :
After spending nights and days trying to book a slot i think from my own experience (might be wrong), for delhi, slots are often released at 01:18,02:18, 08:18, 13:18,14:18,20:18,21:18(try your luck on these times)

All the very best to all who are going to attend the interview.

VO looked like an Indian guy..he was kinda strict but approved almost everyone infront of me except 1 guy.

VO - Why industrial engineering ?
Me - Sir, in future I want to expand my parents’ business and an advanced degree in industrial engineering will provide me with necessary skills to achieve this goal, because in this coursework there are subjects like production systems design, logistics distribution systems and Advanced operation research through which I will learn to determine the most effective ways to use the basic factors of production by implementing the concepts of six sigma and mathematical methods.

VO - Why UTA ?
Me - Sir, as I want to specialise in Logistics and supply chain management and University of Texas at Arlington has specialised track for this program. In addition I can choose upto 2 electives from other engineering or science departments as well, also the faculty there is  very much active in the field of supply chain management and logistics. And I want to learn under the guidance of prof. Eric Jones since he’s working on projects like supply chain optimization and six sigma quality.

VO - You were going to NIU last time ?
Me - Yes sir.

VO - So why did you change your University this time ?
Me - Actually last time also my first priority was University of Texas at Arlington but I couldn’t apply within the deadline as courier services were not operational because of the pandemic and hence got a rejection but this time I applied within the deadline and got the acceptance.

Counter no 27 guy rejected someone girl's VISA 2 places before me. So it's not like Mumbai consulate is approving everyone's visa but most of them are getting approvals.
From what I heard, she was not confident in her answers maybe she didn't prepare for them or she got so nervous she couldn't collect her thoughts and stammered.
I heard her say the following.
1.  San Jose is in top 10 and... so i think he must have asked her why SJSU.
2. I'm switching because i have worked here for this many year... and stammered. so i think he must have asked her why are you switching.
and 1 or 2 more questions which I can't recollect now.
But my point is, These types of questions are not normally asked at Mumbai but they can come if you give VO a chance by showing him you're not prepared and confident.
The next girl got approved within a minute. I heard her say something like ""After my master I plan to comeback to India..."" so you can guess the question. She was confident when she spoke and he didn't ask her many questions.. 
So stay confident and take this as more of a conversation rather than an interview.
Give short, confident and to the point answers. if you're answer is too short for him, he will ask for more information like he did in my interview, so don't worry.

This group(F1 VISA EXPERIENCES) has helped me a lot in my preparation. I was constantly monitoring the post people put here. Kudos to all the people who help out by posting such experiences (I know once your interview is done and visa is approved, you guys won't open this group I know i won't, but still. Thank you).

2. While I was there, afaik, 30 ppl were there and all of the visas got approved, a guy and a girl were bit nervous coz their VOs asked them couple of questions more, but i think their visas got approved eventually.

Status- Approved
http://t.me/f1interviewreviews

Interview Duration: 2 minutes. Was with an Indian-American man.

Handed him my passport, I-20 and SEVIS Fee Payment

VO - Have you ever been outside India?
Me - Yes, I’ve lived in India, the UK, Tokyo, Singapore, did my undergrad in Canada which I finished in 2016 and a Masters in Finance in the US from 2016 to 2017. I returned back to India when that completed and have been working here since. 

Was typing for a half a minute after I finished my answer.

VO - You sound like you know your stuff, and Georgetown is a great school, but don’t you think and MBA and Masters in Finance are very similar? 
Me - I said no because a masters is very specialized, but I want to learn more about managing and leading teams, understanding how to work with companies internationally within financial services, so the broader scope means better prospects in my career.

He nodded, typed for a few seconds.

VO - Tell me about your funding? 
Me - My dad is paying for the MBA, he has worked in banking for 25 years and is currently in Hong Kong. His salary is $xx and savings of $xx. 

Then he said my Visa is Approved, kept my passport to the side and returned my I-20 and SEVIS payment. I asked how long it would take to be delivered and he smiled and said “I tell people 1 week, so when it comes in 3-4 days I become the hero!”

The Delhi Embassy was completely empty, just 2 other people were in the Visa room being interviewed. Officer was a nice guy. Just FYI, I have had an F1 visa in the past, and also hold a B1/B2 visa which I have used extensively - in my experience as long as you sound sensible everything should be fine. Make sure your funding is in order, and just relax - the VO’s are decent enough people.

I went in confidently and I wasn't scared or anything , but because of the walking and the heat I was sweating badly and was out of my breath while answering . I was worried where the vo will think that I was being nervous, but she was pretty sweet about it.  She understood that I was gasping for air because of the mask so she kept nodding with a smile everytime i did that.

2. Dress Neatly and have a smile.  First impression definitely helps ! 
3. Be attentive to what they are asking.

The lady was very professional and she was expecting brief answers with enough explanation. 

Conclusion: Even though I was confident initially, when I got in and saw the no. of people I got really nervous. The embassy had security on another level and it was quite intimidating. My hands were shaking 🥶. Then I kept my palm flat in air, breathed calmly and deeply, then I was able to control the shaking of my hands 😌. Also, I was a bit concerned coz I got only 1 admit, but I answered honestly.

Tip: Don't be nervous, you might get nervous but calm down by using the method I mentioned above. Also, be professional and honest when you are answering the VO.

There were multiple queue .Please check with the security about where to stand as per your time slot . Because my interview was at 8 and I reached there by 745 . I thought it was a single queue to enter and went and stood in the queue for around 10 mins . Thankfully something hit me and I asked the police person standing there . Then I came to know that I was standing in 9am queue so he told me to go front and then I came to know that everyone from 8am slot had already went inside . So he asked me to wait for 5 minutes then I entered the main gate .When i went inside Four counters were running . The first person whom I saw coming out had a reject so I was bit scared but later I saw everyone with a green slip.

Overall I’d say that set the tone in the first 30 seconds of the interview cuz they’d get an impression about you. Most of the time they’d be looking towards their screen. Make sure you’re having eye contact even then. I wouldn’t say not be nervous cuz that’s how everyone would be before the interview. Once you go inside the hall everything would be calm and cool. Don’t go early to Chennai consulate. Go on time. Feel free to ask me any doubts 😊.
I’d like to thank everyone who supported me in this process.

Thanks to him that we weren’t drained.)

-1001285729190,"Visa Interview at Chennai Consulate 
Regular Appointment: June 28, 10AM
Status: Approved ✅ 

I reached the Consulate at around 9AM. They were letting in only those who had their appointments at 9:30AM. Those with 10AM slots like me were waiting in a long queue. I entered inside the Consulate at 10:45AM after slowly crawling through the queue. 

There were 4 counters operating. I was asked to wait near counter number 32. The person ahead of me had her visa approved as well. So that boosted my confidence as I walked towards the booth. 

The Visa Officer (VO) was in his 30s and seemed to be in a good mood. My interview went as follows - 

VO: Hi, good morning. 
Me: A very good morning to you officer. 

VO: Please pass me your passport and I-20. 
Me: Sure, officer.  

Started to type. Asked me to take off my mask for a moment to verify my identity. Began typing again as I wore it back on. 

Next, he took my I-20 in his hand and leaned forward with a curious look on his face. 

VO: So, what are you going to study in US? 
Me: I'll be pursuing Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech. 

VO: Okay, so why Georgia Tech? 
Me: The ECE program at Georgia Tech is one of the top ranked programs in the world. I feel the high quality of courses it has to offer are best suited for my interests in the hardware domain and will help me greatly in my career progress.  

VO: What's your highest qualification right now? 
Me: I have a BTech degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from <college>. 

VO: When did you graduate? 
Me: I graduated in 2017. 

VO: What have you been doing since then? 
Me: I've been working as a hardware engineer at <company> since I graduated. 

VO: Hardware engineer huh, alright. So how will you fund your education? 
Me: I have taken an education loan of <amount1> with my father's savings as collateral. I also have my own personal savings of <amount2> that I saved over the last four years working at <company>. 
(amount1 + amount2 was 1.5 times the I-20 amount)
http://t.me/f1interviewreviews 

VO kept typing something for a few seconds as I contemplated if I screwed something up. 

VO: What does your father do? 
Me: He worked in a nationalized bank for 35 years and retired last year. 

Started typing again. Then asked me to place my four left-hand fingers on the scanner. I was so glad to hear this. 

VO: I'm approving your visa. 
Me: Thank you officer. 

Passed me the green slip. This was a culmination of over two months of intense struggle and sleepless nights constantly monitoring the Telegram groups (at 18th minute of every hour especially) to secure a visa slot. Was so ecstatic to finally get done with it successfully! 

Few points I'd like to share... 

Ensure you sign and date your I-20 beforehand. Unsigned I-20 might be your direct ticket to 221(g), so don't risk it. Just sign and date it. 

I carried three transparent folders with all sorts of documents. Didn't require any during the interview except the I-20. I suppose the non-mandatory documents only serve as a way for you to be confident about yourself and also perhaps indicates to the VO that you have come prepared to answer anything with proof. As they've told, it's good to have something you may not need than need something you may not have. So carry whatever documents you feel you will need for your own peace of mind. 

There are four critical questions that you should prepare for and there's no one-answer-fits-all for any: 

• Why MS/PhD? 
• Why the University? 
• How will you fund your education? 
• What are your plans after you graduate? 

Two more slightly-less-critical questions would be: 

• Why not Master’s in India? 
• Why this University over your other admits? 

All other questions are direct which you will be able to answer even without preparation. 

Do understand that the interview is more a test of genuineness and intent than anything else. It's a system designed for you to pass (think of it to be more like board exams than entrance tests). 

All the best!

Key Takeaways:
1) I arrived at the consulate just 40 min before my appointment time, therefore I didn't had to wait for too long
2) There were somewhere around 30-40 students
3) I know this has been said a lot of time but confidence is the key.. They are approving almost all the visas within a few seconds. Although, they did severely question a few students but ultimately approved their visas at the end
4) Make sure your mask is on while answering the questions. 
5) Ensure that your finances are perfectly sorted.

PS. I got really lucky with the officer IMO. As for my father's profession, i expected a lot of scrutiny (him being retired), but he was not concerned about it. Just wanted to tally the savings and loan amount with I20. The entire consulate was empty during my interview, so it was a swift experience for me.
If you guys have any doubts regarding the experience, or wanna know something... please feel free to ask in the comments section.
Best of luck guys🙌🏻👍🏻

Me: Yes ma'am.... I've never experienced snow growing up in a tropical country, nor will I get an opportunity in the future. So this is my only chance. It's pretty exciting, would be a great learning and living opportunity. I'm really looking forward to it.
VO: I come from a very cold place myself, and believe me even we find Upper Peninsula unbearably cold.
Me: (Lol), oh wow!  you must prolly find Chennai to be extremely hot then...

          ... So when did you finish your undergrad?

Me: Thankyou so much , have a great day.
VO: Thankyou , have a great day.

a few Suggestions off the top of my head:
1) Try to set the tone of the conversation at the beginning itself. Although she seemed pretty casual and informal with me , she was very formal, cutting to the chase and being concise to the student before me.
2) Be relaxed , confident, bold and keep it conversational.
3) speak in a broad sense, dont be too specific, be concise. don't speak out of turn. Don't repeat. Don't provide already available information as answers (Eg: Why U.S ? To pursue my M.S etc.)
4) while speaking about why a particular Uni , dont just go on & on about academics. also speak about the location and the cultural immersion.
Good luck! 👍

Vo : Hey, show me your I20
Me : Good morning officer, sure. 
Vo: Good morning ( looked into i20 for like 1minute  and typed something)
Vo : What course are you going for? (In I-20 it is written as Robotics, Mechatronics and Automation) 
Me : MS in Robotics 
Vo : What experience do you have in robotics?
Me : Mentioned about the robotics competitions I took part in undergrad and also the courses I took. I also specifically mentioned that I had no professional experience in Robotics.

(Vo types for a min)
Vo : Place your left hand fingers on the scanner
(Vo passes a white slip)
Vo : This is the 221(g). Your application requires further administrative processing as I need to make sure everything is alright. Drop your passport in the box beside you. You can check your visa status at CEAC website. ( I got a panic face) Don’t worry, for all purposes your visa is mostly approved unless something goes horribly wrong. I had a friend who went to Worcester, it’s a good school.
Me : Yeah, WPI is an amazing university. Thank you. Have a good day ahead.
Vo : You too.

Update on 24th June : checked CEAC website to see the my visa got issued. Previously it was showing as administrative processing.

Update on 25th June : Received a mail and a message to collect my passport.

Personal notes:- The Vo at Hyderabad is really trying to understand why you are taking a particular course and university. If you satisfy him, he will proceed to finances. All the 5-6 people before me, walked away without their passport and 1-2 of them had the White slip in their hand. Be confident, all will go well. Best of luck everybody. I pray that all your visas get approved.

VO was a tall young handsome American in his late 20's

We were made to wait for 5-10 min beyond our slot time as the VO wasn't there.

There were only two people waiting to get interviewed. I was second. The first person's visa a got approved, the VO even asked her for some documents (He asked her why master's now, is your sibling on H1B (she told him that they had a green card), he even asked her for a CA certificate, some of his questions were not clearly audible so I didn't get them). 

Now, my interview..

VO: please put your passport against the glass this way (he put a passport against it and showed me how it's done)
Me: Good Morning Officer! (While placing passport)
VO: Good Morning Ma'am! 
Please put your I20 too.
(I placed my i20)

He examined my I20's funding section for 1-2 minutes. I had a Graduate Assistantship offer that was offering me a tuition waiver of $14K and a stipend $5K per year. He was probably looking at that, I thought he'd ask me something about it but he didn't. But typed something in his monitor.

VO: Tell me about your background in CS?
ME: Sir, I have earned my bachelor's degree in ECE from GRIET in the year 2019.
VO: What have you been doing since then?
ME: Sir, I took a 6-month break after my graduation to be certain of my interest area and explored all the fields. When I was sure that masters in computer science with cybersecurity concentration was something I wanted to do I started the entire process of applying for master's but then..
VO: but then the pandemic took over so you were neither able to work nor study?
ME: Yes sir!
VO: I understand. Okay! So, who is sponsoring you?
ME: My family is sponsoring me sir! (I forgot to mention savings)
VO: What are the savings?
ME: We have savings of 20 Lakhs sir!
VO: What is your mother?
ME: Homemaker sir.
VO: your father?
ME: He is engaged in the business of XXX. 
VO: what is his annual income?
ME: it's 12 Lakhs per annum sir.
VO: Do you have any loan?
http://t.me/f1interviewreviews
ME: Yes sir, 
a 25 Lakh loan from a Govt. Bank.
VO: Is it on collateral? Or is it a non-collateral?
ME: it's a collateral loan sir.

Counter no.13 VO was same like robert Downey Jr. Don't trust me I'm bad at comparisions, but he's so calm.

2 guys before me were..... No actually maybe 100 before were approved, basically everyone who's clear with what they're saying.
As knowing from the groups Delhi consulate were approving everyone but asking good no of questions, so I prepared about the university and all for 2days and seriously hoping that they'll ask and I should rock. But......here you go
Me: Good afternoon, how are you?
Vo: replied but i didn't hear, asked me pass the I20 and passport.
Vo: so when did you graduate and in what stream of engineering?
Me : I graduate on October, 2020 from chemical engineering stream.
Looking at my I20 meanwhile already placing the passport in down the desk, I was like WHAT....
Vo: graduated in that and now you're going to environmental engineering, say something about it in your own words.
Me: okay so my undergraduation introduced me to the various interdisciplinary fields, ( don't know what you say further but continued by saying) I'm more into climate change stuff and advanced water treatment methods, so I've decided master in environmental and applied. (Not so perfectly replied than while you're reading it now. So you're a winner). 
Vo: what about finances then? 
Me : it's a combination of savings and loan which sum upto 55 lakhs. 
VO: you mean parents savings+ loan? 
Me : absolutely. 
http://t.me/f1interviewreviews
Vo: so florida, do you want to explore? 
Me : For sure. 
Vo: Alright then, place your 4 fingers on the scanner. 
Me : I don't know which hand, so for good I kept right hand, lol. 
VO: Have a great stay at florida. And gave back I20 as you know he kept my passport into the desk long ago. 
I was like oh bhai! Please ask me why this university and why masters, I've preparing those since 2days. Anyway, got the result. 

Suggestions : 
Dude, nothing new was there to suggest. Just prepare for maximum,  this experience might not help you but hope it gives you guys confidence, because that's how I got before my interview. Everyone will get tensed before the interview but trust me ( lol trusting who doesn't even know?) after going inside you'll will definitely get those positive vibes may be due to the ambience just meditate yourself.

Duration:4-5 mins 
VO was male guy with black hair in early 30's

VO: Good morning!
Me: Hi, good morning 
VO: Please pass me your I-20 and passport 

Passed them along with SEVIS receipt. DS-160 we were told by security to keep inside

VO: What is the purpose of your visit to the United States? 
Me: I am going to the US to pursue my PhD in Molecular and Cellular Biology at the University of Arizona
http://t.me/f1interviewreviews
VO: Oh wow! Pumps fist 
I'm from the UofA as well! What a coincidence! (He seems really happy and smiles. I feel a bit more confident, because compared to the bald guy sitting at the adjacent counter, this one was taking his own sweet time and grilling students)
Me: Yes, it's a great school. Has a good bio department and a lot of funding from the NIH 
VO: Yes, yes it does. Are you a graduate assistant or research assistant? 
Me: I am GA for first year, then RA after I formally join a lab and decide a PhD advisor
VO: What will you be working on at the UofA for your PhD? 
Me: Explained my research in cancer biology
VO: Have you ever been to the United States before? 
Me: No, but I was granted the L2 visa back in 2008. My father was the L1 candidate. We never ended up going, but I did receive the visa in my passport. 
VO: Have you gone out of the country before?
Me: Yes, I had gone to xx country in 2019 for my Masters thesis in cancer biology 
VO: This is great, I am approving your visa. Please carry your I-20 visa with you when travelling to the United States. 

*Passes my documents back with the white slip**
Additional points to note - 

1. The VO didn't question me about funding, but he did grill the Masters students that were before me. He wanted funding details, and was taking longer with each candidate compared to the bald guy. 
2. He also inquired them (not me) about their plans after Masters, what jobs they'll get in India, etc. So prepare accordingly

4 counters open, mine was Counter 29.
Famous bald guy was on counter 27. Approved almost 15 visas, denied one while my line processed 2 visas.
Denial was because the guy couldn't explain the source of funds. VO asked at least 10 times ""What is the original source of funds?"" but he kept saying my dad invested in stocks and saved. I guess he was looking for an answer to where the money came to buy stocks in the first place.
My VO was a young guy, American. Was slow and thorough.
http://t.me/f1interviewreviews

VO: Good morning
Me: Good morning!
VO: What is your intent of travel?
Me: Planning to do my MS in ECE at Georgia Tech.
VO: Good, specialization?
Me: VLSI systems and Design with a bit of comp. arch. This falls directly in line with my Bachelors degree and the work I have been doing.
*blurted out some more info about myself, I tend to talk more when I get a little nervous*
I am also currently working for ____. In the same specialization that I intend to pursue.
VO: Oh that's great! How are you planning on funding?
Me: <plans for funding>
VO: What does your dad do?
Me: <role and company, retired>
VO: Last annual income
Me: < blah blah>
VO: Have you travelled anywhere in the last two weeks?
Me: No Sir, I have not.
VO: Congrats, approving your Visa, Read this form it'll tell you when/where to collect your passport. (White slip)
Me: Thank you sir! Have a nice day.

Takeaway:
Just be calm, they just want to talk to you. If you have a straightforward case, there's nothing to worry about. 
Don't lie, they are especially trained to catch you lying.

(Vo passes a white slip)
Vo : This is the 221(g). Your application requires further administrative processing as I need to make sure everything is alright. Drop your passport in the box beside you. You can check your visa status at CEAC website. ( I got a panic face) Don’t worry, for all purposes your visa is mostly approved unless something goes horribly wrong. I had a friend who went to Worcester, it’s a good school.
Me : Yeah, WPI is an amazing university. Thank you. Have a good day ahead.
Vo : You too.

Update on 24th June : checked CEAC website to see the my visa got issued. Previously it was showing as administrative processing.

Update on 25th June : Received a mail and a message to collect my passport.

Personal notes:- The Vo at Hyderabad is really trying to understand why you are taking a particular course and university. If you satisfy him, he will proceed to finances. All the 5-6 people before me, walked away without their passport and 1-2 of them had the White slip in their hand. Be confident, all will go well. Best of luck everybody. I pray that all your visas get approved.

I was asked for my interview confirmation letter, DS-160, and Passport.
My fingerprints were taken and the officer asked my full name and date of birth to confirm my identity. A label was stuck to the back of my passport containing DS-160's barcode.
The whole process was a breeze.

Background stuff :
There were 6 people in front of me, all of them got their visa approved. Some people were asked about their sponsors and financials. I wasn't asked about it at all (I was solid in financials, but it felt weird in a good way).
A person in front of me had some trouble with his DS-160, his location in the form was mentioned as Mumbai. He was asked to step out of the queue, and to get it sorted out, he had to wait to communicate with someone. I changed my DS-160 location from Hyderabad to Delhi about 4 days before the interview.

VO : So like data analytics?

2) Why University, Why program, Why this Specialization.

VO was the 'bald guy'. I Think he is also short, atleast felt like from his sitting posture.

This guy was in real hurry. I too got the same set of questions about my university, father, his annual income n profession.

Although my major source of funding was education loan (40 lakhs equal to my I20 amount).

He didn't ask about education loan and when I just spoke about to mention it he interuppted and said yes I heard it! Felt strange. 

I think only amount of time people stand at his counter is the time he requires to input student's details in the system. As soon as its done you hear the golden words n then next with a hand gesture to the next candidate. 

Documents asked : Passport n I20.

Other points :my slot time was 10:30 am , students with timings from 10-11 am were send FCFS basis starting at 9:15am as few of students before me had slot time of 10:50 too. So you can enter inside roughly 40-50 mins before your slot time. I suggest go 1 hour early and no sooner than that from today's experience as it also keeps raining intermittently. After you get inside you are made seated for roughly 30 mins under a shed. 

Keep calm and you will get through it as I had seen no rejection at any counter for 15-20 mins inside the interview hall.

Me: Told about my loan and savings
VO: What do your parents do?

Counter 4,5,6 were open.
http://t.me/f1interviewreviews

I went to counter no 5. There was a very polite gentleman who took my interview.

I Had some issues with fingerprints however he didn’t fuss about it and while I was doing that I believe he did my background check as well.

He then asked me the following:

Q. What are you going to usa for?
A. I will be going for my MS in Human Resource management at Rutgers university 

Q. Why this? (He meant why this course basically)
A. I explained about my work background in the HR field and my current interests in hr strategy & analytics and how there are opportunities in the industry for this. How we rely on data to make decisions even in the field of hr

Before I can say more he said that makes sense and my visa is approved. 

I was in shock for a moment so asked “what”. To which he politely replied your visa is approved, I am keeping your passport and you will get it in 4 days. 

I was all smiles and said oh that’s great, thank you so much. 

I was so excited that I couldn’t find my way out from the counter 😂

I prepared a lot and he didn’t ask me anything, so don’t be so hard on yourself and chill. I couldn’t but I believe being calm is key. 

Hope this helps.

There were 3 counters when I first entered the room. An American lady was seated at the first counter followed by 2 American males. The 2nd and 3rd counter VOs were rather quick with their approvals in comparison to the first.
A new counter soon opened and I was sent there, with 2 folks in front of me.  The discussion with the first man went on for over 25 mins (Not for F1 VISA) and with the second one for over 10mins (Additionally, the VO kept leaving his counter for some work which organically kept escalating the anxiety, lol). Due to this, they shifted me to the second counter which was moving quickly. Finally, interview time:

VO: Friendly American male in his mid30

Interview:
Me: Good Morning!
VO: Please pass me your I20 and passport
Me: Passed

VO: Okay, please tell me the purpose of your trip
Me: Want to visit the US to pursue my master's in Information Management at the University of Washington, Seattle.

VO: Okay, but it's mentioned Info Science
Me: Yeah, that’s the Stem Nomenclature

VO: Okay, so why Information Science or rather why Information Management?
http://t.me/f1interviewreviews
Me: I wanted to choose a program that would give me an amalgamation of technical knowledge with Data Querying and Data Visualization as well as help me dive deep into the prescriptive side of Analytics with Data Science and understand the Business Management of data and resources in the field of Business Intelligence and Data Analytics and the Information Management program fit the bill right. This would help me become an astute Data engineer and help solve complex business problems.

VO: Okay, is this the same field you're working in?
Me: Yes, I've been working as a Data Engineering Analyst for 4 years.

VO: Okay, sounds good.

VO: Who would be sponsoring your education?
Me: My parents and I would be sponsoring my education we have total liquid funds of 77lakhs amounting to 106k USD and assets worth 2.5Cr

VO: What do your parents do?
Me: My dad is a doctor, has been in the profession for over 35 years, and mom, a tuition teacher

VO: Okay, what's their combined annual income?
Me:  18lpa

VO: Alright, I'm approving your VISA. please follow the Covid guidelines while in the USA.

( Looks at the screen and I thought he is going to reject me)
But then he tears the white slip, keeps the passport in the tray and said Your Visa is Approved
Please update your i20 before you travel. 

The bald guy was very polite but then his tone gets kind of intimidating, but dont worry he approved the F1 students unless and until you are confident  and are able to answer clearly.
There was a guy who got rejected 2 seats before me, I dont the reason but I think he was very under confident and nervous.
There was a lady in front of me for her B1 visa and he rrjected her too, she was not able to communicTe properly
But most of the Students were exiting with a white slip when I was in the waiting area.

First, they checked the DS-160 at the Consulate entrance. 
The guard asked me my slot time and let me in.
Once you go in, they ask you to put your folder, watch, and anything else in your pockets in a tray, and the security guard scans you.

Further inside, there is a big, open, waiting area with many rows.
They check your DS-160 and ask you to go and sit in 1 particular row.
From there you can see the counters inside from the windows.
5 counters were operational - 23, 27, 29, 31, 33.
They send in 1 row in around 15-20 mins.

When you go in, the guard inside allots the counters on random.
Suddenly, he asked, ""Any F1 here?"". I raised my hand and surprisingly I was the only one who raised my hand. He called me forward and asked me to sit in front of the seats of counter no. 27

VO: What have you been doing since 2017?

Me: Thank you so much, sir! Have a nice day.

He took my passport but didn't pass any slip. Some applicants had asked about it before me, and he said it's not required, so I didn't ask him about it.

They don't seem to be too keen if you have worn formals or not. A couple of guys were in jeans and shirts, and their visas also got approved. That being said, I went in formals to not get any unnecessary attention.

Overall, it's a pretty chill process. Didn't feel much anxiety after entering the embassy, and looking at other's approval does help in boosting your mood and confidence.

Hope this helps!

I've wanted to pursue a career in data analytics and hence I have selected this course. The Data Science and Analytics program at GSU is ranked 11th among the public universities in USA. Data science course at GSU offers something unique called Insight Sprints that involves experiential learning. Insight Sprints are a collaboration between organizations and students to solve real world problems. Companies would visit student groups with a problem and a huge set of data. Students get to solve these problems using practically what we study. Thus, it will help me upgrade my skills and have a corporate exposure in college, which will in future help me in my professional career.

Do not wear anything that will make you sweat more, because the area is open until you actually enter the counters area. People also came in joggers and slippers, personal opinion, don't be so casual. 😬 Be ready to remove watch, specs, handkerchief everything for the security check.

- The VO interviewed one guy for 15mins while I waited for my turn. Meanwhile the bald guy on counter 27 approved 13 students while I waited on counter 31 😅

VO: Hi, Good morning 
Me: Hi sir, good morning, how are you? 
VO: Great pass me your i20 and passport 
Me: Sure sir, passed the documents 
VO: So tell me about your course. What you are going to study?
Me: Explained about the 30 credits and other credit requirements. Kept it quite short. Also told that the terminology in i20 and offer letter are a bit different. 
VO: Great, why have you chosen Madison?
Me: Was telling about my ece undergrad and trying to explain from where my interest arouse in CS (Interrupted in between) 
VO: Awesome, what about the funding?  Ahh I see, its a fully funded program (looking at my i20), congratulations!! 
Me: Thanks a lot sir. 
VO: Are you married? 
Me: Happily not (happily in a bit silent manner) 
VO: Madison is a great place, you will enjoy a lot there. All the best!! 
Me: Thanks a lot sir 
VO: VISA approved!! You will receive it within a week
Me: Thanks a lot sir. Have a nice day!! 

Final tips: Be calm and friendly. If you can give convincing answers, you can pretty much expect approval. Make sure you know about the course well and especially why you are going for that course. 
One guy probably got a rejection before me. His answeres were ""Data Science is a very good field and my elder brother asked me to study it"" The VO gave him 2-3 chances but he was unable to explain why this couse.

And you have to wait for quite a long. There was a long queue. Probably around 30-40 people. My passport got checked in 4 places, i20 twice. There are two three waiting queues. And sadly no place to sit 😰

Situation:
1. The security was letting people having slots up to 11:00 AM inside at 8:45 AM
2. 4 counters were open. 27, 29, 31, 33
3. Around this time, counters 29 and 31 were occupied by B1/B2 applicants (couples with small kids) and their interview was going on for over 20 minutes over the respective counters. Only counters 27 and 33 were available for F1 visas during those 20 odd minutes
4. A girl was rejected at counter 33 while I was in the queue. Couldn't hear much, but her funding seemed to have 3 to 4 sponsors along with a loan
5. The bald VO was at counter 27 today. He rejected a guy 2 seats ahead of me. The guy was previously rejected as well, and when he was asked how his situation has changed since his previous application, his answers didn't satisfy the VO and instead he got a stern reply and a visa reject
6. The bald VO is very quick! I think he approved 15-20 people within the 10 minutes I was inside the interview area

Takeaways:
1. Most people are getting approved. As long as you have decent savings, and an overall decent profile with no negative history, you'll breeze through it!
2. Be honest and concise with your answers, especially with the famous bald VO. He is very clear with what he wants and is very experienced. Trying to beat around the bush or being evasive to what he asked will only get you into trouble. Also, please keep a justification ready for everything you say, from income to savings. Good luck!

A girl in front of me visited the counter and he took her interview for about 3-4 mins. (*Including a 1 min awkward silence*) I got a little bit tensed up as the other counters started seeming faster suddenly. She ultimately got rejected due to inconsistencies of sibling information in the DS160 and the Interview responses.

Opinion:
Don't go early unless you like to wait. If you reach 10-15 mins before you'll get in without having to wait at all. You'll just have to wait in the line inside the consulate. If you reach 35-40 mins early you might have to wait till they call for your slot. Don't arrive more than 30 mins before your scheduled time.

VO: Congratulations! Your Visa is approved.
Me: Thank you Sir! Have a great day :)

(P.S: I would suggest to already get a new ds-160 with your appointment's location if you have different location, just to be safe and avoid such issues. 

Otherwise interview is pretty chill and like a normal conversation. I haven't heard of any rejections. All are getting their visas approved. Just be prepared with your answers and speak confidently. That's all.

Also, they don't follow slot timings. They allow people go inside as they come. Maybe because it was less crowded. So if you want, you can go early and get done with your interview.)
Hey. This is my interview experience which was a bit unique due to ds-160 issue. So would be helpful to others if they face the same issue.

Reached at 7:45, entered consulate at 8, (no point in going too early, they will let you in only half hour prior to your slot. After security checks and everything, waited inside for 20 minutes approx before being send to the interview building. Everyone’s interview  while I was there went for around 5 -15 minutes. And everyone came out with a green slip so yayyy.
My background: my father is retired from 30 years of central government service and moms a house wife. I have 4 years of work experience with very little savings because I ate it or I spent it traveling so I had a tonnes of things to be worried about before the visa interview. My parents savings and little bit of my contribution got me 30 lakhs of liquid and 1.5 crores of assets. I carried all documents with me. I had atleast 3.5-5 kgs worth documents. 

Vo was an American guy in late 20s or early 30s 

Vo : good morning 
Me : good morning 
(Nervousness was clear)
He asked for my passport and i20.
I gave.

Vo: where did you do your undergrad from 
Me: I completed my bachelors in computer science and engineering from BVB
Vo: when
Me: 2017(stammering)
Vo: what did you do since then
Me : answered that I had a job but I quit on may 30(so in my ds160 I have filled that I am working and I was afraid if I say not working now would be an issue but I have trouble lying with a straight face and was worried about using “is” and “was” during explanation which would give away the slight Golmaal so just stuck to explaining him the situation.
And then I explained my role at my project
Vo: why utd
Me : (forgets everything I had prepared for this question) gave random answer about their credit structure and courses offered.

What does your father do: I told him the truth and explained that my parents have real estate which yields them rent and other sorts of income around 8-12lakhs per year. I had 6 months bank statement to explain this just in case he asks but he didn’t ask. I went on to explain my savings and my parents savings and real estate all in one question. He didn’t stop me from talking which made me wonder bald guy would never let me talk so much 😂 

He asked me what would you do after this is done. I explained I am happy with the work I was doing right now but I just want a much senior role and would come back to it.

Your visa is approved. He passed me the green slip and the moment I touch it, I saw nervous air evaporating from me. 

I can’t really say don’t be nervous because that won’t happen for most till they have received visa approval. Just be prepared in your own way and that would give you the confidence to answer. I knew I had back up documents to back everything I say which helped me :) good luck

(P.S: My course being an uncommon one, he wanted to know more about it probably & asked something casually. I couldn't catch it & said sorry Sir I didn't get the question. He repeated and even then I couldn't. He figured that made me nervous so he just said no worries, that's fine, that's okay!
So overall a very non-intimidating and great interview experience! )

* Formals are not mandatory, so i went in semi formals no tuck too.

* Listen to the question being asked by the VO properly and then answer. Dont be in a haste to get the interview done with.

* Do attend as many mock interviews as you can and keep practicing the questions. Practice is the only thing that can give you the confidence you need for the interview.
* The process is actually pretty simple and breezy. They just want to know some information about you, thats it.

Once you enter, the security guard runs a metallic detector on you. Then you proceed forward.

There were 2 counters open. First counter there was a lady who asked for my passport and ds 160 , she was verifying my details. Then she sent me to the next counter. 

There was a man who asked me those same  documents. He told me read some policy which was written in front of the counter which stated that I would provide details which are true to the best of my abilities etc. He told me to read it in mind. After that he took my photo, and told me to place my left 4 fingers, right 4 fingers and my 2 thumbs on the fingerprint scanner.

It was drizzling continously in Kolkata for the past 3 days. I was there at 7:45 am but there were decent number of people waiting. We were made to wait outside and form a queue based on our appointment time. One by one we were let inside.

Once I entered inside, a security guard told me to put my folder in a basket for screening. I was told to pass through the metallic detector keeping my both hands up. Then a security lady checked my passport and ds 160. Then I was sent further inside.

Next, I was waiting in a room , where there was a lady , who checked my passport and ds 160. after checking she told me to carry my passport , i20 and sevis in hand. I had to wait there for a while before I was sent to the interview room.

When my turn finally came, I entered the interview hall. There were 2 counters open, one was a counter with a lady where she checked the same documents again and told me to proceed forward.

# I reached US embassy by 9.00 am and saw that they were allowing inside irrespective of slot time. I sat down, took sometime to get comfortable and went inside at 9.30( lockers are available to keep phones. And there's a guy who will charge to keep ur bag safe if ur carrying one. Wallets are allowed inside) 
# Security check happened then kept i20, sevis receipt and passport ready in hand. There were 4 active counters. I was asked to wait at counter 21. Where a Native American woman in her mid 30's was interviewing someone. 

# She took 10+ mins to  to interview him. I could hear that there were some legal obligations topic between them so I thought it must be a H1B visa interview since they need a no obligation certificate. My turn came, 

Me : Good Morning Officer, how are you?

(No reply) 
VO : Pass me your passport.

Me : Yup, here it is. 

VO : Can you scan your fingers on that. 
( I've already placed my fingers knowing that she'll ask me to do that next) 
 She smiled And said okay. 

VO : So where are you going?

Me : I'm going to US to pursue my Masters in Computer Science with Majors in data Science. 

VO : How did you come to know about this University?

Me : I did quiet a bit of research online with the requirements I have i.e, course structure which provides a combination of CS and DS subjects, the professors, active researches, the Infrastructure and prepared a list of Universities which caught my eye. That's how I found this University. 

VO : So you know anyone in this University? 

Me : No officer.

VO : Okay, how is this course going you help you? 

Me : I aspire to be a Data Scientist who can implement state of the art tools and techniques and create Models which can predict the future and provide an action plan to companies. And Data Science is a feild which demands an in-depth knowledge in a lot of areas in this technology. And this course will help me gain all that. Also, I've been working around data for nearly 2 years and I believe I have the necessary fundamentals to grow in this field and that's why..  
( She intervenes here) 

VO : Where did you do your Undergrad?
 
Me : I did my Undergrad in Computer Science and Engineering Department in 2016. 

VO : Okay so were you working after?

Me : Yes officer, Since then I've been working as a Python Developer at TCS. 

VO : okay what about funds? 

Me : My parents are sponsoring me with 25 lakhs of thier saving and I have taken an education loan of 30 lakhs from a Govt. Bank and I also received a scholarship of 8k from University. 
VO : congratulations for the Scholarship.

Me : Thankyou Officer with a smile(although we wear mask the whole time).

# Take aways: In delhi, you can go inside irrespective of your slot time.
# VO was trying to see how I can explain why I want this course. (Which was crucial as she emphasised more on that) 
# I could see people smiling and coming out until I was there. So I guess its positive to say most of the F1 visas were getting accepted.
# Stayed at Hotel Superb ( near railway station), Paharganj. Booked in goibibo and best for someone looking for an affordable stay.  Costed me around 1600/- for 2 days. 10 mins far from embassy and 10 mins away from Shivaji Stadium( for OFC).

Me- Yes 
VO-  So Baylor?
Me- Yes
VO- Why Baylor?
Me- Both academic and non-academic reasons. Academically, one of the top 25 research institutions in the world, great infrastructure and opportunities and a multidisciplinary environment. Non-academically, wanted to be in an area with a  warm weather plus the place is known for it’s low cost of living and being on the grad student stipend, that’s an important factor so it doesn’t add on any financial stress.
VO- Makes sense. What are you planning to do your dissertation on? 
Me- Cancer Immunology 
VO- Any particular cancer type?
Me- Uhm no. The university requires grad students to complete a minimum of 3 rotations before selecting a lab. So based the lab I select, I will be working on the cancer type being worked on in the respective lab.

During the interview, the guy in front of me was unable to explain how he had the savings when his father's income was low. The VO gave 2 chances to explain but he was stammering. The VO told him that he had only 1 more chance to answer the question and if the VO wasn't satisfied he would reject the visa. The guy answered something else and finally the VO approved his visa. 

Just be confident and don't stammer. Keep your answers short, crisp and to the point.

I stayed in US for 4 years on H4 visa and I mentioned that in the ds160 as well but this particular VO didn't ask anything about that.

Counter No: 32 (bald young guy)
http://t.me/f1interviewreviews

(I didn't want the bald guy as he only asked about father's details. My father's income is less. Wanted to mention my family income. Anyway it got approved, so thankful to the guy. :D) 

Me: Hello sir, Good morning. 
VO: Good morning! Your documents please (they announced earlier to keep our Sevis receipt, I20 and passport ready)

VO: what does your father do?
Me: he owns a business which is selling of wholesale goods. 

VO: how much is his annual income?
Me: 8 lakhs per annum

VO: how much savings he has? 
Me: Parents - 16L, Personal - 23L. 

VO: Loan? 
Me: Yes I have a loan too of 35L.

VO: (looks into his computer, keeps doing something. He did typing for around 3 mins.. I got scared, because for others, it didn't took more than 30 secs, whereas I was on counter for 3 mins now. One of the possibilities is that he was checking details about my brother who is in US on h1b visa. I also got worried thinking that the income was low. After some time, passes me the white slip) 

VO: Your visa is approved
Me: Thank you so much. 

Takeaways :
1. Don't stress much. 
2. Be prepared to wait for 1 - 2 hours.
3. You can deposit your phone on the kiosk as soon as you enter the gate after getting your passport sticker marked. They charged 50rs for 1 mobile. 
4. Funny but there were some rickshaw wallas who were selling umbrellas outside the gate on opposite road. Pretty helpful for people who forgot to carry one. 

PS:
I know its been difficult for all of us because of the pandemic. First deferring admits, waiting for a year and then struggling for slots  because of the second wave. Keep hanging there, keep hustling. Its difficult to be patient at such times. But this too shall pass. We all will go to US.

Thank you to the admins who are running this channel, and to people who submit their experiences. This has been of great help :)

They were approving visas in general, I guess. My visa officer was Indian American in his early 40s I guess. He was chilled and I felt pretty calm about myself while waiting. There were other visa categories being conducted as well.

ME: thank you
VO: what about your funding?
ME: apart from full tuition scholarship and graduate teaching assistantship of $18,000 (I guess he didn’t see that earlier because then he checked my I-20), my father will be sponsoring me. 

There was a pause on his side so I continued

ME: he has annual income of about 20 lakhs from his real estate independent contractor business and has current savings of 40 lakhs and his net worth is 15CR

ME: I chucked as well
VO: alright, I don’t need to ask anymore questions, your visa is approved. Your passport will be there in a week.
ME: thank you officer. Have a great day 

Tips: there were two groups of people (one couple and another mother daughter)in queue in front of me, even though it wasn’t my turn, I was making eye contact with the officer. I just stood there confident not caring about what other people were doing around.
Be confident.

Me: Good Morning Ma'am
VO: Can I see your passport and I-20 please?
Me: (sliding documents through the slot) Here you go
VO: Please place the fingers of your right hand on the scanner
Me: Done
VO: So you're going to school at... *Checks I-20* the University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign yes?
Me: Yes
VO: Why did you pick UIUC?
Me: It's extremely well known in the Aerospace industry, comes well recommended by senior engineers at Boeing (where I work), and they found me an advisor whom I really like.
VO: You work at Boeing?
Me: Yes
VO: In the United States?
Me: No, in India
http://t.me/f1interviewreviews 
VO: You picked UIUC over Embry-Riddle? (Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, extremely well known in the US for any course related to Aviation and Aerospace)
Me: Yeah, I think the advisor did it for me haha
VO: Sure, makes sense, UIUC is a great school

*Intense typing*

VO: What was your undergraduate score?
Me: My GPA was 9.06 on a scale of 10
VO: *raises eyebrows*
VO: Your GRE score?
Me: 336

*More intense typing*

VO: Do you, by any chance, have a copy of your resume on you?
Me: No

*At this point I know I'm going to get a 221g. Cursed myself for getting every document, big or small, from 10th marksheets to original degrees, but no resumé*

*More typing*

VO: How are you paying for your education?
Me: The University is funding the whole thing.
VO: *Checks I-20* Okay, got it

*A few seconds of typing later*

VO: I'll be right back

*Now that's the sure-fire 221g signal. I'm not surprised. What was intriguing is I wasn't asked about my research at all.*

*VO comes back, takes a yellow slip*

VO: So your Visa might need some more processing, so I'm sending you to window 1, where they'll tell you the additional documents we need. There's no specific timeline for this, but we're tracking every student and their start dates, so you needn't worry.
Me: Alright, thank you

Takeaways: The interview in itself was chilled out, and there's no need to be nervous. As for 221(g), they seem to be handing out a lot of them, and a bunch of folks from my college in fields like Material Science and Robotics got them, so
1. Please schedule appointments as early as you can if you work on something that's specified in the Technology Alert List (TAL)
2. If you're working on TAL-related stuff, carry a resumé
3. Submit documents ASAP if you get a 221g, they're handing out a lot of them and they seem to be understaffed

VO: Okay, also I see that you've been to Russia as well?
Me: Yes sir, actually it was a transit visa, so I did not exit the airport.

( VO looked convinced at this point and after that started with the normal questions )

Takeaways: Interview was extremely short. They make you wait for a looong time, as only 2-3 counters are functional.
I could over hear almost 5-8 interviews, all were approved, irrespective of income, savings, fumbling while answering, etc. Same generic 3 questions were being asked. (More if he felt necessary)
Just stay prepared to answer finance related questions, nothing else is being asked.

VO: What’s your undergrad in?
Me: Computer Engineering.

VO: Right hand four fingers on the scanner. Your visa is approved. Have a nice day and enjoy your stay in the United States!
Me: Thank you!

There were just 3 or 4 counters open and the other counters were taking time for the interviews. Only this VO was blazing through F1 interviews. Approved 4 F1s back to back within a span of 3 minutes or maybe even less. Did not even ask why this course if you changed streams. One guy in front of me was a Mechanical Engineering graduate and was going for MS in CS. No change of stream questions asked. 

One positive thing to note is that even though the other VOs we’re taking their time, I couldn’t see any F1s getting rejected.

Tips: 

* Try to be as calm as possible. Just keep in mind that being anxious or nervous will never help.
* Formals are not mandatory but i personally feel it makes you more confident.
* Listen to the question being asked by the VO properly and then answer. Dont be in a haste to get the interview done with.
* Do attend as many mock interviews as you can and keep practicing the questions. Practice is the only thing that can give you the confidence you need for the interview.
* The process is actually pretty simple and breezy. They just want to know some information about you, thats it.

Takeaways: My interview itself was pretty short but it was the longest amongst the ones that heard. Almost everyone else was just asked the same 3 questions: undergraduate, father's profession, father's income. That's all. They key is confidence and conciseness.
There were two other VOs who were taking time with the interviews but as long as you have sufficient funding and  nothing suspicious in your profile, you should be good.

-1001285729190,"In the light of the current pandemic situation, U.S. embassies in India have cancelled their current appointments till the middle of May, and people are unable to find replacement slots until February of next year in some cases.

The vast majority of the people are having a hard time finding slots for their visa interview in time before the start of their classes, and additional interview slots are required to accommodate the people waiting in line. We have worked hard for our admissions and spent a good amount of money and time in the admission process. Many of us deferred our admissions last year, and we are now facing the same problems again this year, even after a long wait.

The uncertainty in the availability of slots is causing extra travel here and there across India and even after going through all this, most of the people are receiving emails from the embassy saying that they are unable to honour our applications, for employees this is becoming another major issue. Apart from this most of the IT companies in India expect at least 45 days of notice period before resignation. Without having done with visa we are not sure about when to start the resignation process and unclear when to relieve and what date should we take the flights. Doing shopping by following all the lockdown restrictions is almost something new. Because of the pandemic situation flight tickets, prices are skyrocketing, countries are imposing travel bans, new restrictions are being added up now and then and some times the flights themselves are being cancelled.

It will be a great help to us if you ask the concerned authorities to find some solutions like conducting the ""ONLINE INTERVIEW"" , “INTERVIEW WAIVER” or Allowing applicants with negative test report instead of cancelling appointments.",1798,NA,NA,[],,

The MSIT course engaging in potomac will helpful to enhance my skills for my career growth. (She stopped me here)

I would like to study in depth in field of MIS . All my admits offer me this course but Potomac has unique combination of subjects like(<<<<<<< and assurances, mutimedia computing , distributed systems ) which are relevant for my work. And also ,Potomac offers me thesis in my final semesters where are my other universities offer me non - thesis program in this particular field.

Me: mam to reach my ultimate career goal of becoming a real estate developer I need to learn a lot of things like how a construction company finances are to be controlled, how to select a subcontractor, what are the front end plannings to be done, how to give a best tender and many more which was not in my undergrad curriculum.. 

While I was telling it I am pretty sure she din listen to me, and was reading comments on me give by 1st attempt vo.

Later she called someone and he was standing beside her. They both where discussing..

Vo: you have been to usa last yr, why?
Me: it was my family trip on a vacation.

Vo: I see that during ur visa for b1/b2 you mentioned in that your travel plan is for 15days, but you have been for 70days, why?
Me: mam i accept that I mention is ds160 that my plan as 15days, but in interview I clearly mentioned the vo that I havnt planned anything, I would plan after my visa is approved. Later during my plan to usa I extended it as US is such a vast country, do you seriously think i can see usa in 15days? (She din reply, but gave an expression like not possible) I understood I cant cover many places in that period of time, while am spending so much money to go usa y will I try not to cover many places, so I extended my plan. Later I extended 1 more week as my bro’s wife and kid are travelling back to india, and she cant travel all alone with a small kid I thought to extend and come alone with her. 

(Both the vo wer luking each other and gave an expression like yaa not a problem)

Vo: how many employers do you have?
Me: (repeated similar answer as in 1st attempt but in detail)
Only 2 mam as its just a architecture firm we dont need much staff. And construction sites we hire on contract base 15-20 depending on the site and scale of project.

Vo: why masters now?
(She repeated the question and i repeated the answer)
Me: mam to reach my ultimate career goal of becoming a real estate developer I need to learn a lot of things like how a construction company finances are to be controlled, how to select a subcontractor, what are the front end plannings to be done, how to give a best tender and many more which was not in my undergrad curriculum.. 

Vo: how does this master help in reaching ur ultimate goal?
(I tried to explain much in detail)
Me: see mam am if someone, or lets take u, u want to have a house n approach me I design and construct ur house and hand over to you. These are small projects.. if I do masters with the knowledge I gain, I can start a construction, project & facility management company with the contacts and clients I gained from past 10yrs. I knew many builder and developers who can become my clients easily and I can work on that big scale projects. Later after say 6-7 yrs or 10 yrs I can get confidence and invest my own money to become a good developer.  Without this masters I can never work on big projects till I die and can never reach my goal.

Both vos where very much satisfied.. I could understand from their expressions. N that other vo guy left and this lady was typing for very long time. 

Vo: how are you funding?
Me: You wont have any issues with my funds. I have more than 76 lakhs in  my personal saving account.. apart from that I have 48 lakhs worth of just gold as movable property.. I have 8.85 cr worth immovable properties..  on top of that my parents earn around 22lak per annum..

And Tampa being a 360 day sunshine city it's more like climate of Bangalore All in all, a conducive environment for my studies.

American Universities provide a strong foundation of theoretical knowledge as well as emphasize on building practical skills .The global exposure provided by these universities will help me find better career prospects.

Also, I am keen to learn from Prof. XX and Prof. YY as they have done some brilliant research in healthcare operations and policy

Date: 18th November

Out time: 11:45 P.M
University: University of Central Missouri
Counter: 23
Status : VISA APPROVED ✅

VO: Sweet American lady in her mid 30's (her eyes shape made her look like Chinese. She's a blonde, with a tall stature)
Interview Duration: 1 - 2 minutes

There was person outside the consulate who checked my pass port and let me inside the consulate gate to enter a room. Once entered inside, security check happened and they let me out of the room. Then I had to walk for a long distance to enter the visa interview block. There was a queue outside that block. They let people one by one inside. Inside that block there were 2 counters. One for each counter were being interviewed and one for each counter was made to stand opposite to the counter to proceed next. The rest were made to wait in a queue inside the block.

I’ve seen 5 to 6 people, coming outside from the interview block, only 2 were happy, and rest were feeling low.
It’s starting to clutter my mind, so I kept saying this to myself, “dude you have a good job profile (but I have low scores in Btech), you’ll get it man if you stay cool and confident. So, I have done deep breath 10 times, which made my anxiety get low, and get to a stable state. And post that I’ve been singing Vijay’s Kutti Story song in my head to avoid getting any thought 😂😂

When I went inside there were 2 more people in other counters (18 and 21, person in 18 got rejected). To be honest I wasn’t effected by that, but I started to feel bad for him, then realized and got back to senses, and was standing with a firm posture (remember your standing posture also plays a good role in this), and looking straight in the officer eyes. I’ve said to myself about onething, “Dude, You’ve practiced your best, So stop worrying about the result”. My mind went thoughtless state (calm and cool and confident).


ME: Good morning Officer, How are you doing? (Very energetic Voice)
VO: Very good morning, please pass me your passport and I-20

ME: Sure maam, here you go

VO: So, Have you travelled to US before?
ME: No, Ma’am

Typing … Typing … Typing …

VO: Which University?
ME: University of Central Missouri Ma’am

VO: Why this university?
(This is the best answer I’ve prepared myself, but when she saw me in the eyes, I stammered like anything, which effected the flow of the answer, but overall this is what I said)

UCM offers excellent course curriculum, and it offers plenty of electives to choose, which consists of a subject named Distributed and parallel computing systems, which I’m specifically looking for. Professor Reza has been researching in distributed and parallel computing systems with evolutionary computing in multi-core systems since 10 years, and if given a chance, I want to be a part of his research. As all these aspects are inclined with my interests and my work experience, I chose UCM to pursue masters in CS

Typing … Typing … Typing …

VO: So, how do you plan to quarantine yourself?
ME: I’ll be quarantining myself for 14 days in one of the nearby hotels to the university, and post that period, I’ll submit a health report to the university before the commencement of classes

VO: How many universities you've applied to and what are they?
ME: Told

Typing … Typing … Typing …

VO: How's your funding?
ME: Told

Typing … Typing … Typing …

VO: What's your other admit again?
ME: Northwest Missouri state university (NWMSU)

VO: Any other university you've applied to?
ME: Texas Corpus Christi (TAMUCC) maam

Typing … Typing … Typing …

VO: So, why you've chosen Missouri particularly?
ME: Firstly, based on the curriculum. Nothing’s more important to me more than curriculum. But, one more thing I’ve considered is Missouri has balanced temperatures, it’s neither too hot nor too cold

VO: So, how do plan to travel. You wanna take a direct flight?
ME: Yes maam. I’ll be taking a direct flight from Hyderabad to Kansas city

VO: “So out of the admits, how did you decide on your current university”
Me: “well, when I compared both the curriculums, CMU’s program is more of a techno managerial course, so it has technical data analytical subjects as well as managerial subjects like accounting, finance, economics and other such courses. And NEU’s course solely focuses on the technical aspect of DS, and I wanted to focus on the technical part of DS right now, so NEU was the right fit for me.

Me: Good Morning Sir, how are you?

VO: So you are going for Northeastern! Why NEU? 
Me: So, NEU provides a well balanced coursework when it comes to Engineering Management. My long term goal is to be a supply chain Manager in a Manufacturing industry here in India hence courses like Supply chain Analytics, Process control etc are being taught in NEU with a good faculty... (So here I was cut in Between)
 
VO: Seems like you know your stuff very well! Tell me why Supply chain manager job role? 
Me: As my background is in manufacturing, I learned that slowly automation and engineering management tools are being applied hence creating a large gap in the technical workforce which the companies hold. After graduation I would apply in 3 top industries - Reliance industries, Trident group and Vardhman Manufacturing industry as they are rapidly shifting towards automation and have a lot of opportunities for an Engineering Management graduate.

VO: Why did you not go with UMass Amherst?
Me: I received an admit into the CE program in which I could focus on things like Embedded Systems and stuff. But I'm interested in Deep Learning and my program at ASU has better opportunities for that. A couple of professors at ASU are doing some amazing work in this field as well.

VO: What do your parents do?
I told her about their professions. She double checked certain details.

Told her just the income and no other info regarding savings or loan. She double checked the number.

VO: How do you plan to quarantine yourself?

Visa experience:

Consulate : Chennai
Slot time : 12:00
In time: 11:15
Out time 11:35
University: Northeastern University Boston
Vo: lady aged 25-30

There was person outside the consulate who checked my pass port and let me inside the consulate gate to enter a room. Once entered inside, security check happened and they let me out of the room. Then I had to walk for a long distance to enter the visa interview block. There was a quee outside that block. They let people one by one inside. Inside that block there were 2 counters. One for each counter were being interviewed and one for each counter was made to stand opposite to the counter to proceed next. The rest were made to wait in a quee inside the block. 

When I went inside there were 4 more people before me. And all four got rejected. To be honest I was shivering but it's in ur hand to get a visa. So I distracted myself  by singing a song and I dint give an ear to other people's interview. 

Pro tip : you are being watched when u are waiting opposite to the counter to go next. So start looking at the VO straight to face from there on. Don't watch down or here and there. Have your passport and i20 alone ready in ur hand. Keep rest of the items inside your file.
Wait till you are being called to come ahead.


VO: come ahead with your passport and i20.
Me: good morning mam. Here you go.
VO: good morning. Thank you.
(Greeted smiling. Though your smile won't be visible much cz of your mask, I still did and she did too)
VO: So Northeastern University right?
Me: yes mam. To pursue masters in data analytics engineering.
Vo: why this course?
Me: It was during my college when I developed interest for this domain after I read a paper called correlative analysis of beer and diaper. From then on, I decided to go with the field. Owing to which I started my role as a software engineer in LNT INFOTECH where I worked on 3 analysis projects.a
VO: wait so u are working. When did u graduate?
Me: I was working. I graduated in 2018.
VO: 2019?
Me : no mam 2018.
VO: so who is finding you?
Me: I have an education loan of rs 3500000 from HDFC credilla. Apart from this my dad is sponsoring me with his savings of rs 4000000.
VO: what is he doing?
Me:  he is a master chemist in a fertilizer company.
( My dad is NRI. But I was so cautious to not leave a word about it.)
VO: so how many admits?
Me: I have 6 out of 8 admits. ( I laughed while saying this jus to keep things cool. ) Should I name them?
VO: ( she laughed too) oh no. Plz dont.
Me: ( gentle smile)
VO: so have u travelled anywhere in past 14 days?
Me: absolutely not.
Vo: what is ur travel plan?
Me: I have spoke to my seniors and they asked me to take a direct flight. Have not looked much into it yet. Once you approve my visa, I will be planning to leave by ded end.

( If u think ur interview is going good, leave this word "" once you approve my visa"". This gives an additional confidence on u)

VO: So what are you planning to do in Biotechnology at the University? 
Me: Answered. 

She was typing a lot and asked if I had a passport photo. I had one and gave it to her. She spent a few minutes trying to get it scanned with help of another lady who was telling her how to get it done, and assisting her. This took a few minutes and I wasn't asked any questions during that time. Took her a while and she got it done. Asked for verification of fingerprints and done! 

VO: You'll get your passport in five days or so. Make sure you follow the quarantine rules. 
Me: Yes definitely! Thank you so much!

(Went in a little early and sat there for 40 mins or so.)

VO was an American bald guy. Seemed sweet to me. He had already approved 3 visas in front of me so I had a good feeling about the interview. 

Me: Good morning Sir, How are you doing today?
VO: I am doing great. Pass me your passport and put left hand for scanning. 

(At this point of time I had put my right hand and he corrected me saying that you have to put your left hand)
Me: Oh I am sorry! 

VO: It’s okay. What was your undergraduate in?
Me: Chemical Engineering. 

(He got alerted. I could clearly see that from his posture.)

VO: What was your CGPA?
Me: Told.

VO: Pass me your i20 please. 

VO: What does your father do?
Me: He worked as a __ in _ a govt organisation for 36 years and retired last year. 

VO: What will be your majors in apart from chemical engineering at this university?
Me: Mostly Energy and Environment. 

VO: Tell me different forms of energy
Me: I went on and told him and emphasised on renewable energy because I had worked in that area. 

VO: That’s all? Tell me more forms of energy. 
Me: Umm I repeated the same answer again (At this point I went blank. I didn’t have anything to say. I was nervous and I thought I lost it.)

VO: Tell me some other form of energy. 
Me: Blank again. 

VO: Maybe something like nuclear energy. 
Me: No, I am not planning to do my majors in that. I want to work in energy and environmental sector. I want to work in Pollution control as well. 

VO: Did you have any subject in your undergrad related to nuclear fusion? 
Me: No

VO: If given a chance will you do majors in Nuclear fusion at masters level?
Me: No I want to stick to renewable source of energy. 

VO: Have you done research in the similar field before? 
Me: Yes Sir, I have pursued research in Nanotechnology and Energy Integration. 

VO: Oh! Did you say nanotechnology? 
Me: Yes Sir.

VO: Please tell me more about your research in Nanotechnology.
Me: I have worked with Hollow glass microspheres wherein me and my team analysed different parameters.

VO: What are the applications of these particles?
Me: These are majorly used in batteries, apart from that these are used in paints and pharmaceuticals as well. 

VO: Do you know about hydrogen storage? (At this point I realised he was googling about the nano particles)
Me: Yes Sir. 

VO: Could you please give me more examples of hydrogen storage?
Me: I was blank again. I tried to calm myself down and told about where hydrogen storage is used. 

VO: Have you ever worked with HEDM?
Me: No I have not. 

After this point I got 10-15 more questions about different hazardous chemicals and nano particles which are used in weapons and everything. I answered that I haven’t used them in my research and am not planning to work with them either. 

(He kept on typing for a long time. In the back of my mind I was thinking that I might get a reject now but I dont want to come back to Mumbai and give the interview again. 😢)

VO: Congratulations. I am approving your Visa and Gave me the white slip.
Me: Thank you so much Sir.

Me: Let me know if I’m audible Sir 
VO: Told me to get a close to the microphone

Me: Very few universities in US offer me 30 credits worth of grad level courses in the field of power systems. MTU offers me a total of 36 courses in the same stream. So, its an opportunity for me to gain more skill sets. Then I started to speak about the ongoing projects in the university, he jumped to the next question.

VO: Hi, pass me your passport and I-20
Me: Hi ma'am, sure.
Passed my passport and I-20

She scanned my passport and kept on checking the computer while typing something, then looked at my I20 once and back at the screen gave out a huge sigh, I just kept my cool and continued looking at her for any questions.

VO: How many admits? 
Me: 3 ma'am.

*VO Hands me my I20 and white slip, keeps my passport.*

VO: Your visa is approved!
Me: Thank you ma'am, have a great day!


My 2 cents : Dress well, I was dressed in office formals, it creates a good impression, even when you walk or stand at the counter show confidence and stand straight, try to maintain eye contact with the officer. Your confidence and motive should reflect in your body language because they hardly get 5 minutes to judge you so they will observe you keenly.

All the best to all of you! Hope to cross paths with you soon! 😊",1461,mumbai,approved,"['when it was my turn she pointed at me to keep waiting and she took a short break.

A guy before me was rejected, at first he was asked alot of questions, so I was prepared for everything 
As I heard their conversation, the VO asked him that is he applying for the 5th time, And he said yes. The VO also asked him what changes has he made since his last application and he was giving something abt the letter he received from the university professor blah blah.. VO again asked the same question and he said that he has already started his program online
N then VO said I am sorry we cannot approve ur visa.

So when I heard about the 5th attempt, I was totally relaxed because it was not the same situation for me. 
But the guy argued with the VO n asked why sir I have started my program online
and VO said something and then the guy was like can I apply again
VO was answering him very politely bt his expression said something else😅
At this point I was tensed because he seemed frustrated 
Bt he called me n As I went to the counter
he greeted me like
Good Morning Ma'am n that too with a wide smile
So I was totally relaxed

the question he asked was

At this time before I completed  my answer he was printing a white slip And I was totally afraid n thought why is he rejecting me I didn't do anything that could cause me a rejection.
But then it was

VO : I am approving your visa ma'am, Have a nice day ( he then further told me about the instructions to be read on the white slip)

VO was an American guy in his early 30's.
 
A little background: 
I already have a valid B1/B2 visa. And have travelled to the US three times.

I have already started my Fall ‘20 virtually

ME: Yes sir, I have travelled to the US three times. 
         (I stressed on three times, and he raised his eyebrows)

VO: So you are going to University of Texas at Dallas?
ME: Yes sir, I will be pursuing my MS in Business Analytics at UTD

VO: How are you funding your education?
ME: I have a secured education loan of XX lakhs, My father will also be sponsoring me he has a total savings of XX lakhs, I was also offered a scholarship of XX USD by UTD. As I have started my semester virtually, I already paid my tuition fee for Fall 2020

VO: What does your father do?

VO: What's the quarantine plan?
ME: Self quarantine for 14 days, already arranged my accommodation

VO: I am approving your visa, scan your right hand four fingers 
ME: Thank you sir, have a good day

And then handed me the white slip and asked to read it for further instructions. 
 
Note:
In my DS 160 I have mentioned Hyderabad as my consulate, but booked the appointment and VAC at Mumbai. I didn’t update my DS 160 and didn’t face any issues on this aspect
I have travelled to Mumbai through flight and there are no quarantine rules as such.
No one is checking for your IP address or who booked your visa slot. I believe that it was hoax message circulated in the groups
While I was in the waiting area for my interview there were 12 people and I could clearly listen to the questions that were asked. There was a bald guy at counter 32, he asked the same 3 questions to 4 students (GPA, Sponsorhip and APPROVED). He finished interviewing 4 students while the other counters were still asking questions 
There were 30-40 students before my interview and 90% of the applicants were having a white slip in their hand.
I personally felt the Mumbai consulate has a pretty good approval rate. 

Suggestions: 
When asked any question on financials/sponsorship directly/indirectly, give them a chance to approve your visa by providing all details of your finances and specify the amounts. Don’t wait till the VO asks you again a question regarding the amount.
They will keep typing the whole time you speak. It might make you feel nervous. Don’t worry about it and focus on what you are speaking.
It’s better to be prepared on questions that you might expect according to your profile and Don’t memorize answers, just focus on the key points and answer spontaneously

I was 5th in the queue for F1 visa. They sent only 6 candidates in from waiting area.   All counters were closed and it was a very very silent place.  
Then at counter no. 33,  they did our document verification. The lady over there asked for passport and i20 only. Scanned barcode from the passport.
After that I have been told to go to the  counter no. 37. I was the first candidate at that counter.  
The VO was around 30 year old American lady.  She signaled me to wait for a minute.  Then she called me.  She greeted me first very nicely. 
The conversation was :
VO: Very good morning. Hope u are doing great this morning.  
Me: Good morning ma'am.
VO: Please pass me your passport, I-20 and sevis. 
I passed my documents. 
VO : You can make use of the sanitizer. 
Me: Sure ma'am.  Thank you.  
She scanned the bar code from my passport  more than 10 times. 
VO: The systems are warming up this morning. It will take a minute.  So please wait.  
Me : Sure mam
After 2-3 mins
VO: oh it is not Working properly. I have to restart the system.  Please wait for a moment.

The VO was an american lady (maybe in her 30s).



As soon as I went ahead for my interview, the fingerprint scanner stopped working for some reason. Thus, for testing purpose, they asked for my prints initially, and at that time it worked. So, my fingerprints were the first thing that was done in the interview (maybe a good thing).



Me: Hello! A very good morning to you.

VO: Good Morning.

VO: So, how many admits apart from Columbia?

Me: I got 4 other admits. 

VO: So, why Columbia?

Me: Started talking, but got interrupted within 30 seconds.

VO: How are you going to sponsor your education?

Me: It will be through a combination of my family funds and an education loan. I have availed an education loan of ₹ YY. Apart from that, my family would be sponsoring me for any additional expenses.

VO: What does your parents do?

Me: They are currently retired. But they worked at XXX earlier.

VO: What was their salary?

Me: Told.

VO: Have you had any visas to any other countries?

Me: No, I had none.

VO: Congratulations, your visa has been approved.

Me: Thank you! Have a nice day.



Just a normal interview. My advice would be to keep it short and simple. Don’t over explain your answer. Maintain your calmness, and portray confidence. 



One more thing, it is a good thing to go early even if your appointment is late. They did not check/ask my slot time at any moment. So, the early the better I believe. 



Hope this helps. ✌️

Docs asked: Passport, i20, SEVIS fee receipt and Photograph

No one has mentioned it here but there is one more step before the Visa interview that troubled me quite a bit. 
This is supposed to be a siimple step - where an Officer (Officer1) screens your passport, i20 and sevis before permitting you to the VO.

Officer1: Pass me your Passport sevis and i20. You can keep rest of the docs away.
Me: Passed the Docs
Officer1: Long continuous typing and flipping through passport travel history. 
(Note: I had a history of travelling to some off countries like Cammbodia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan on work and educational conferences.)   
Me: Thought it was a normal check. Everyone was given back their passports and i20s and asked to proceed to VO
Officer1: I am keeping your passport. Need to check something. Please wait.
<After a long 20-30min wait. I am called to the counter again>
Officer1: Do you have a photograph? I need to capture one.
Me: Yes office. Here you go. 
Officer1: Please wait.

I have been waiting for a good 45 min and could hear a bunch of VO-interviewee conversations. I could gauge some commonalities in the rejected cases (~6-7). The main one is - unclear and inconcise responses and low confidence. As long as you answer honestly and to the point of the VOs questions you should be good.
<another 15 min go by and I was wondering what happened. Meanwhile there was a bottleneck in the flow because of my case as there is only one Officer1> 

Officer1: Calls me again. Proceed to VO.

Citations to Profs ratio is the highest in the world. Implies the impact of reasearch output of the brillant profs. hence this is my best option
VO: Do you have any other admits?
Me: Yes 3 more. Columbia, UCLA and Purdue. Got a reject from MIT.
VO: I see you also got a scholarship. Is that one of the reasons why you chose Gtech?
Me: Yes, that is indeed one of the reasons but I did get scholarships from my pther admits as well. But this is significantly higher.
VO: Okay. Good. Did you take education loan?
Me: Yes, 40Lakhs for the duration of the course.

Me: Thank you office. Have a good day. But when will i get my passport. 
VO: As you mentioned in the delivery method. Once the processing is done. You will receive the info via sms and email.

On that day the cec application status showed rejected. I hypothesized a couple of reasons why it could be. But in any case, everything is genuine and fair. hence was confident.
The next day, it changed to Issued. The good news after the dilemma was much sweeter. :)

Inside the consulate at the document verification window, they asked for passport, I-20, SEVIS fee receipt and a photo. The lady there looked into my photo and asked someone behind and went inside. I was very scared. She came out, returned the documents and told your photo is inside the passport. I don't know what happened inside.

** Tips: for Mumbai consulate
Avoid having bags. Outside the consulate there is the facility to keep the mobile phone. But they don't keep bag. The auto wala there may take you to some locker room to keep bag, but they charge 500 rupees with additional 300 auto fair. And if your visa got approved then the auto wala tells to give some amount for basis.",1930,mumbai,approved,"['vo: what would you do there?

I was smiling inside the mask until I got out of the consulate.

I saw 2 guys in front of me. One was accepted he had few backlogs but he defended and answered well.
The other was a PhD he already had done a masters ( and I think an MBA ) and now he wanted to go for PhD but was rejected.

The consulate was hella empty. Only one counter was open and all others did not even have a facility for mic and speaker.
There was a lot of waiting, my slot was at 9.45 but I went near the counter at about 10.15-10.20
I think I saw a few people getting approved while waiting.
I think it took about 20-25 mins for anyone to go in near the counter and to come outside.
I think there were about 10-15 max people in the waiting area.
